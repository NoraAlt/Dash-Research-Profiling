However, metallic alloys have failed to prove high wear resistance alongside acceptable biocompatibility. Recently, metallic glasses (MG) have attracted more attention for joint replacement implants due to their superior wear resistance and acceptable biocompatibility, however, they are brittle material and constrained in size to few centimeters. Therefore, MG coating layer on ductile-core metallic alloy like stainless-steel would overcome the drawbacks of MG and develop a well-functioning joint replacement implant. In this research, FeCrMoCB MG is laser cladded on nickel-free stainless steel using three levels of specific energy, scanning speed, spot size and overlap percentage to develop different amorphous-crystalline composite structures. The cladded samples showed superior wear resistance in both dry and Ringer's solution conditions (up to 270 times that of the substrate) demonstrating comparable wear rate with common metallic biomaterials that leads to promoted durability. Furthermore, the cell-culture test applied to FeCrMoCB coating layer and substrate showed good cell morphology and growth on both surfaces indicating an acceptable cytocompatibility of both coating layer and substrate.|| In this study, the use of membranes for partial oxidation of methane (POM) for syngas production is investigated numerically in a catalytic membrane reactor (CMR). The reactor considers using a multilayer oxygen-permeable membrane made of macroporous Ni-Al foam substrate in the presence of LaNi0.9Pt0.1O3 catalyst. The CMR was fed with air in one side and a mixture of fuel (CH4) and helium in the sweep side. Because of its symmetry, half of the domain was meshed in the full three-dimensional (3-D) domain and ANSYS-2019-R2 was used to perform the numerical simulations. For modeling oxygen permeation across the membrane, a source/sink term was created in mass and momentum equations using a series of user-defined functions (in C++) to be compiled and attached to the software. The indirect approach for methane conversion into syngas was adapted in the numerical model considering steam and dry reforming reactions. The model was validated using the available literature experimental data on the same CMR. The simulations were performed over ranges of operating parameters in order to improve the performance of the CMR for syngas production. The effects of sweep fuel concentration, feed air flow rate, and sweep gas flow rate on CMR performance were investigated. The results showed that increasing sweep fuel concentration reduces its conversion. All reactions were quenched in the outlet tube, because of the increased flow velocity and lack of O-2. The counter-current flow configuration resulted in much better selectivities of CO and H-2, compared to the cases of cocurrent flow configuration (89% and 73%, compared to 38% and 23%, respectively). The increase of oxygen concentration at the permeate side of the membrane while increasing the feed air flow rate leads to a reduction of syngas selectivity, along with an increase in fuel conversion. The fuel conversion showed a sharp reduction from similar to 53% to similar to 5% for an increase in sweep gas flow rate from 5 L/h to 30 L/h at a fixed sweep fuel concentration of 10% (by volume). The selectivities of CO and H-2 decrease to <5% for sweep flow rates of >30 L/min. This indicates insufficient availability of oxygen for fuel conversion at higher sweep gas flow rates, because of reduced temperature within the CMR. For sweep flow rates of >30 L/h, the gas temperature even cools in the axial direction toward the membrane, resulting in deteriorated performance of the CMR.|| Heat exchangers are used to transfer energy from one medium to another and increase contact area for higher efficiency. In case of fluids, higher flow area would lead to high/low flow zones that severely affect the fluid dynamics and thermal performance. Channels are used to distribute the flow uniformly to fully utilize the whole heat exchanger area. The flow uniformity in a flow distribution manifold is dependent on several factors such as flow rate, inlet and exit locations, and the manifold and channel geometrical configuration. In the current work, flow distribution measurements were performed using a particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique in two types of rectangular manifolds. The experimental results are further verified against the results obtained from numerical modeling with similar trends. The flow distribution in U- and Z-type arrangements are evaluated and compared with ten channels incorporated in the design. It was found that the flow is more in the channels near the inlet for U-type design, while more near the outlet for the Z-type. An increase in the inlet flow rate enhances the flow distribution for the U-type while results in more maldistribution for the Z-type. For the U-type, the normalized velocity varies from 1.34 to 0.52 in a wide manifold, and between 2.82 and 0.18 for a narrow manifold. A U-type wider manifold is recommended for all conditions examined in this work since at lower flow rates, both have similar mirrored distribution, while at higher flow rates, U-type manifold has better flow distribution.|| In this paper, an experimental investigation is carried out on internal convective heat transfer of SiO2/water nanofluids in a copper tube for a fully turbulent regime. Nusselt number and convective heat transfer coefficients of nanofluid at three different volumetric concentration (0.001%, 0.003%, 0.007%) of nanoparticles were estimated. Local convective heat transfer coefficient at different locations along the tube at varying Reynolds number was also observed. With volumetric concentration of 0.001% of SiO2 nanoparticles, maximum enhancement observedwas 8-9%. Whereas at 0.007% volumetric concentration of SiO2 nanoparticles, a 27% enhancement in convective heat transfer coefficient was observed. The decrease in the heat transfer rate was observed in axial direction. Particle migration, chaotic movement of the nanoparticles and fluctuations in the fluid and increased thermal conductivity of the nanofluid are considered the possible reasons for this enhancement.

One of the effective global mitigation strategies is sequestration of huge quantity of CO2 deep below the ground level for a long period of time. An important issue is to ensure the permanency and safety of the sequestration process due to the associated pore-pressure buildup. It is necessary to have correct estimates of the pore-pressure buildup, ground uplift and re-activation of any existing fault during the process of CO2 injection and long-term storage. In this investigation, the effects of reservoir size and boundary conditions are investigated by means of geomechanical modeling of the deep Biyadh sandstone reservoir in Saudi Arabia. Currently, carbon dioxide is not injected into the actual Biyadh reservoir. In this investigative modeling, CO2 is injected for an injection period of ten years using a single injection well at the center of the reservoir. The developed modeling scheme for a single injection well has been extended further to include multiple injection wells. For multiple injection wells, the reservoir size and locations of injection wells are varied to evaluate their effect on the pore-pressure buildup and ground uplift. The reservoir stability analysis has been performed using Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion for both small and large reservoir models, with the same injection parameters. The simulation results demonstrated that pressure buildup and ground uplift are relatively higher for reservoirs with small sizes and closed boundaries; while in the case of large sizes and open boundaries, the pore-pressure buildup and ground uplift are relatively lower. Moreover, the effect of the reservoir size and boundary conditions on the reactivation of faults during CO2 injection has been evaluated. The stability analysis performed in this study shows that injecting CO2 into larger size reservoir is safer as compared to smaller size reservoir. Injecting CO2 with multiple injection wells will cause pore-pressure buildup of huge magnitudes. The modeling results show that suggesting a representative volume for the reservoir during CO2 injection can under-estimate the pore-pressure buildup and fault re-activation that can cause the reservoir failure and leakage of the stored CO2.|| A thermo-economic comparative analysis of steam production using a solar-assisted cogeneration (SACG) and a conventional cogeneration plant (CCG) with and without carbon capture systems has been conducted. The plants considered to produce electricity and process steam of 500 ton/h. Several parametric studies were carried out on the effect of natural gas price, steam quality, gas turbine capacity and solar multiples (SMs) on the Levelized cost of steam (LCS). Results show that in a CCG plant that comprises a 20 MWe gas turbine, the LCS is $8.11/ton of steam and $3.61/ton of steam from a plant with 100 MWe gas turbine capacity for a natural gas price of $3/GJ. The cost analysis of SACG plant with SM of 0.1 shows that 28% of the total annualized costs are solar system related while it contributed only about 9.17% of the annual steam generation. An increase in SM from 0.1 to 0.9 increases the CO2 avoidance from 61 to 262 ktons/annum for the SACG plant with 20 MWe gas turbine. CCG plants with CO2 capture technologies were found to have lower LCS in comparison with that of SACG plant. The impact of carbon credit implementation on the LCS has been also investigated and reported in this article.|| The performance of a multistage direct contact membrane distillation system (MS-DCMD) is experimentally investigated using a laboratory-scale three stages system. The effects of operating conditions on the system performance are studied for parallel, series, and mixed flow stages connections for the feed and coolant streams. Results showed that the productivity of the parallel flow arrangement is well-higher than the series and mixed flow arrangements due to fewer temperature changes from stage to another. The experimental investigation showed that maintaining the feed and permeate temperatures at the required values required high energy consumption for heater and chiller circulation baths due to the high conduction heat transfer between feed and permeate sides across the membrane of the DCMD stages. Energy analysis showed lower specific energy consumption and higher gain output ratio for the parallel flow arrangement of the MS-DCMD system operating at feed temperature around 60 degrees C. Salt rejection factor of 99.7% had been achieved for feed salts concentration of 35 g/L.|| Risky and aggressive driving maneuvers are considered a significant indicator for traffic accident occurrence as well as they aggravate their severity. Traffic violations caused by such uncivilized driving behavior is a global issue. Studies in existing literature have used statistical analysis methods to explore key contributing factors toward aggressive driving and traffic violations. However, such methods are unable to capture latent correlations among predictor variables, and they also suffer from low prediction accuracies. This study aimed to comprehensively investigate different traffic violations using spatial analysis and machine learning methods in the city of Luzhou, China. Violations committed by taxi drivers are the focus of the current study since they constitute a significant proportion of total violations reported in the city. Georeferenced violation data for the year 2016 was obtained from the traffic police department. Detailed descriptive analysis is presented to summarize key statistics about various violation types. Results revealed that over-speeding was the most prevalent violation type observed in the study area. Frequency-based nearest neighborhood cluster methods in Arc map Geographic Information System (GIS) were used to develop hotspot maps for different violation types that are vital for prioritizing and conducting treatment alternatives efficiently. Finally, different machine learning (ML) methods, including decision tree, AdaBoost with a base estimator decision tree, and stack model, were employed to predict and classify each violation type. The proposed methods were compared based on different evaluation metrics like accuracy, F-1 measure, specificity, and log loss. Prediction results demonstrated the adequacy and robustness of proposed machine learning (ML) methods. However, a detailed comparative analysis showed that the stack model outperformed other models in terms of proposed evaluation metrics.|| In this study, 3D printing of Ti6Al4V alloy is realized and the characteristics of the printed layer are examined. The morphological structures and metallurgical changes in the printed layer are assessed. Temperature and stress fields are simulated in line with the experimental conditions. Since the air gaps are present in between the loose alloy powders prior to the printing, the effective properties incorporating the air fraction are determined and the effective properties are used in the simulations. Thermal conductivity of the loose alloy powders with the presence of air gaps is determined by incorporating the virtual experimental technique. It is found that the printed layer is free from micro-cracks and large scale asperities; however, some small pores sites are observed because of the release of air around the loose powders during the printing. Microhardness of the printed surface is higher in the top surface of the printed layer than that of as-received solid alloy. In addition, the friction coefficient of the printed surface remains lower than that of the conventionally produced solid surface. The columnar structures are formed in the mid-section of the printed layer and slanted grains are developed in the region of the top and the bottom surface of the printed layer.|| Ion transport membrane (ITM) is considered to be one of the promising techniques for the separation of oxygen from the air for clean energy applications. Studying flow configurations of gases around Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) membrane is presented and discussed in this paper. The effects of the sweep mass flow rate and impingement configurations for the gases flow in the feed and permeation sides have been investigated. In this regard, flow with single or double impingement and impingement with different angles have been simulated and analyzed in order to identify the configurations that would provide the maximum permeation flux. Results show that increasing the sweep flow rate, directly, increases the oxygen permeation flux. It is also found that, in case of single impingement, decreasing the distance between the nozzle and the membrane (H), directly, increases the oxygen permeation flux for constant sweep side nozzle (slot) width (D). The permeation flux increases from around 2.9-3.66 mu mole/cm(2) s for the ratio H:D from1:1 to 1:4 (i.e., decreasing H to one-fourth of its value). Results show that the double impingement flow gives lower results than the single impingements by about 35.7%. The results also revealed that the optimum configuration is the parallel flow with vacuum in the sweeping side, which gives the highest permeation flux with an increase of more than 41% from that of the parallel configuration with a sweeping gas. Using carbon dioxide as a sweeping gas is better than helium.|| Here, environmental dust cleaning from an inclined hydrophobic surface by rolling liquid droplets has been studied and the influence of fluid droplets on the dust removal rate has been examined. The distilled and carbonated water droplets at different volumes were incorporated and the inclination angle of the dusty hydrophobic surface on the droplet motion was explored in the experiments. We demonstrated that the carbonated water droplet had higher translational velocity than the distilled water droplet on the dusty hydrophobic surface. The bubbles formed around the droplet surface acted as gas cushions at the interface between the solid surface and the fluid droplet while lowering the friction and pinning forces and enhancing the droplet translational velocity on the surface. Collected environmental dust has various components, some of which can dissolve in water while creating resorption/nucleation centers for bubble formation in the carbonated water droplet. The interaction between the bubbles and the dust particles at the liquid-solid interface enhanced the rate of dust particle movement into carbonated water. For a small-volume droplet (20 mu L) at a low surface inclination angle (delta = 1 degrees), the rolling motion of the distilled and carbonated water droplets ceased on the hydrophobic surface at early periods.|| Percussion drilling is a type of laser drilling operation for which optimized 5-axis trajectory planning has been developed. While percussion drilling is less advantageous in terms of local thermal loading and achievable part quality, it is used extensively in industry, due to its simplicity of automation compared to on-the-fly drilling. Thus, a TSP-style trajectory planning algorithm has been developed for percussion laser drilling. The novelty, in this case, is concurrent planning of 5-axis time-optimal point-to-point movements within the sequencing algorithm, and direct minimization of the total travel time, rather than just distance (in two Cartesian axes), as is the method for which a significant portion of TSP solvers and trajectory planners in the literature has been developed. Compared to currently applied methods, 32-36% reduction in the beam positioning time has been achieved. Also, 39-45% reduction in the peak magnitude of vibration has been realized. Limited benchmarking with the state-of-the-art TSP solvers from combinatorial mathematics, considering only 2-axis Euclidean distance as the objective function, indicates that the proposed sequencing algorithm for percussion drilling is sub-optimal by 9-12%. Thus, it can still use further improvement in future research. Nevertheless, the trajectory planners that have been developed in this paper for percussion drilling have experimentally demonstrated very promising improvements in terms of motion time and smoothness. As more advanced laser control electronics with deterministic execution and rapid synchronization capability become available, such algorithms are expected to facilitate significant production gains in laser drilling processes used in different industries.|| One of the most immediate technologies to mitigate the emission of carbon dioxide is carbon capture and storage. This study investigates different thermal design alternatives to increase the capacity of adsorption system given a desired cycle time. This is equivalent to investigating the reduction of the cooling and heating times during the adsorption and desorption processes, respectively. The thermal design investigation involves the variation of bed aspect ratio, the option of using water as a coolant, and augmenting the bed by fins with varying length and pitch. Mg-MOF-74 is used as adsorbent since it shows high CO2 uptake at flue gas conditions. An experimentally validated CFD model is implemented by using user-defined-function (UDF) linked to the ANSYS Fluent program. Results show that rising the bed aspect ratio from 2.8 to 41.6 improves the CO2 uptake by 13% and reduces the desorption period to the third. Additional improvement in the CO2 uptake (10.9-13.6%) can be obtained by cooling and heating the bed by water as a function of the bed aspect ratio. The improvement jumps to 22.2% if fins are used to augment the heat transfer rates in the bed. The optimal CO2 uptake enhancement (35.2%) is achieved by using finned annular-pipe (fin-pitch is 12.5 mm) as the adsorbent bed with water cooling. This design methodology can be adopted to other adsorption systems, including solar-driven adsorption chillers and solar-driven adsorption desalination systems.|| Ceramic-based nanocomposite membranes are gaining great attention in various applications, such as water treatment; gas separation; oil and gas, amid their superior fouling resistance and remarkable chemical/thermal stability. Here, we report for the first time the use of spark plasma sintering (SPS) process to fabricate a porous alumina-carbon nanotubes (Al2O3-CNT) nanocomposite membrane for water treatment. The challenge is this work is to achieve a balance between the amount of porosity, desired for a high water flux, and the membrane strength level, required to resist the applied pressure during a water flow experiment. The effect of SPS process parameters (pressure, temperature, heating rate, and holding time) on the microstructure and properties of the developed membrane was investigated and correlated. A powder mixture composed of Al2O3 and 5 wt % CNT was prepared with the addition of starch as a pore former and gum Arabic and sodium dodecyl sulfate as dispersants. The powder mixture was then sintered using SPS to produce a solid but porous nanocomposite membrane. The structure and microstructure of the developed membrane were characterized using X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy. The performance of the membrane was assessed in terms of porosity, permeability, and mechanical properties. Moreover, the adsorption capability of the membrane was performed by evaluating its removal efficacy for cadmium (II) from water. The microstructural analysis revealed that CNT were distributed within the alumina matrix and located mainly along the grain boundaries. The permeability and strength were highly influenced by the sintering pressure and temperature, respectively. The results indicated that the membrane sintered at a pressure of 10 MPa, temperature of 1100 degrees C, holding time of 5 min, and heating rate of 200 degrees C/min exhibited the best combination of permeability and strength. This developed membrane showed a significant removal efficiency of 97% for cadmium (II) in an aqueous solution.|| Surface cladding and coatings are commonly used to protect structures against corrosion in corrosive environments. In this paper, electrochemical properties of friction stir diffusion cladded ASTM A516-70 with corrosion-resistant aluminum alloy grade 5052 are studied. The effect of process parameters, tool rotational and traverse speeds on the corrosion behavior of produced cladded steels was comparatively assessed. Electrochemical analyses revealed that the cladded steel sample provided good corrosion protection performance in comparison with the un-cladded steel substrate following an immersion test of up to 21 days in 3.5% NaCl medium. Increasing the tool traverse speed was found to negatively affect the corrosion resistance. Optimum parameters for the selected cladding system were found to be a 500 rpm tool rotational speed, and a 50 mm/min tool traverse speed for protection against general corrosion. Meanwhile, higher traverse speed demonstrated stable passivation behavior and, therefore, lower propensity for pitting localized corrosion. Post characterization of the exposed area indicated that tool shoulder marks were favorable spots for the accumulation of corrosion products.|| Most oil and gas production wells have plenty of corrosive species present along with solid particles. In such production environments, CO2 gas can dissolve in free phase water and form carbonic acid (H2CO3). This carbonic acid, along with fluid flow and with/without solid particles (sand or other entrained particles), can result in unpredictable severe localized CO2 corrosion and/or erosion-corrosion (EC). So, in this work, the CO2 EC performance of API 5L X-65 carbon steel, a commonly used material in many oil and gas piping infrastructure, was investigated. A recirculating flow loop was used to perform these studies at three different CO2 concentrations (pH values of 4.5, 5.0, and 5.5), two impingement velocities (8 and 16 m/s), three impingement angles (15 degrees, 45 degrees, and 90 degrees), and with/without 2000 ppm sand particles for a duration of 3 h in 0.2 M NaCl solution at room temperature. Corrosion products were characterized using FE-SEM, EDS, and XRD. The CO2 EC rates were found to decrease with an increase in the pH value due to the increased availability of H+ ions. The highest CO2 erosion-corrosion rates were observed at a 45 degrees impingement angle in the presence of solid particles under all conditions. It was also observed that a change in pH value influenced the morphology and corrosion resistance of the corrosion scales.|| Heat transfer from replicated hydrophobic and transparent PDMS surface to a water droplet is considered. The laser texturing of alumina surface is carried out to obtain hydrophobic surface and later the textured surface is replicated by polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) via a solvent casting method. An experiment is carried out to assess the water droplet pinning on the replicated inclined PDMS surface while keeping the replicated surface at uniform temperature (308 K). The flow and temperature fields inside the inclined water droplet are simulated in line with the experimental conditions. The flow velocities inside the droplet are validated through the data obtained from the particle imaging velocimetry (PIV). It is found that the velocity predictions agree well with the PIV data. The droplet heating results in a circulation cell inside the droplet due to the Marangoni and the buoyancy currents. Increasing inclination angle of the PDMS replicated surface enhances the maximum velocity inside the droplet, which is more pronounced for the large size droplets. The Nusselt and the Bond numbers increase with the inclination angle of the PDMS surface.|| Increasing efficiency, improving energy consumption, and optimizing energy in industries are more than ever considered by researchers. Some methods such as nanoparticles use and porous medium are used to increase the heat transfer rate. For this reason, in this paper, simulation and optimization of a two-dimensional tube with the presence of water-silver nanofluid and porous media have been performed to improve heat transfer. Different profiles of the rate, pressure, and temperature of the two-dimensional tube at volume fraction, porosity coefficient and Darcy numbers have been obtained and finally, the results are compared. Then, the Nusselt number and the friction coefficient in the range of Darcy numbers, porosity coefficient, different R1, and R2 were investigated. The results show that the Nusselt number and the friction coefficient increases and decreases with increasing the Darcy number, respectively and also, the Nusselt number and the friction coefficient reduces by increasing the porosity coefficient. Particle swarm algorithm method is used to optimize the results. Three methods of Shannon entropy, LINMAP and TOPSIS were examined to obtain the best solutions for the two objective functions studied in this study. The results showed that the Shannon entropy method show more optimal results. Finally, we can say that the best final value for the Nusselt number is 387.42 and for the coefficient friction is -0.02469. These values are obtained by taking the porosity, internal radius, external radius, and friction coefficient as 0.98, 0.05, 0.9, and 0.00228, respectively. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The enclosure used for flow and natural convection analysis is subjected to sinusoidal varying temperatures at the boundaries. Calculations were performed for specific parameters of the Rayleigh number (Ra = 10(3)-10(6)), porosity ratio (epsilon = 0.1-0.9), Darcy number (Da = 10(-5)-10(-2)), Hartmann number (Ha = 0-100) and nanoparticles concentration (phi = 0-0.08). The numerical results are presented by velocity profiles, isotherms, streamlines, and Nusselt number. They indicate that the isotherms subject to estimation variations under Ha boost from 0 to 100 as Ra enhances. At high Ha, the conduction transfer mechanism is more obvious. Also, it is seen that the convective heat transfer becomes stronger with the enhancement of the Ra while it detracts with the rise in Ha. Due to the Ra increase, the flow cell becomes stronger. For Ra = 10(6) and higher Hartmann numbers, the isotherms remain constant which is an indication of convection predominance.|| Even though the renewable technologies are getting a gradually increasing share of the energy industry, the momentum of its growth is far away from outweighing the dominance of fossil fuel. Due to the concern for ozone depletion, global warming, and many more environmental hazards caused by fossil fuels, it is essential to substitute the conventional energy sources with renewables. Since this replacement cannot be done overnight, the conventional energy technologies should be integrated with renewables to minimize the pace of adverse effects on fossil fuel-based industries in the meantime. This way, the industries can be more efficient by utilizing waste heat, which accounts for 50% of the total energy generated now. This review paper outlines the role of solar energy in the generation of power and cooling systems that are capable of utilizing low-temperature heat sources below 400 degrees C. The review is primarily concentrated on line-focused concentrated solar power (CSP)-assisted solar technologies to be integrated with organic Rankine cycle (ORC) and absorption cooling systems. Photovoltaic and similar multigeneration systems are also discussed in brief.|| This paper presents a numerical model to study the process of vapor condensation on surfaces characterized by film-wise condensation with the presence of Non-condensable gases (NCG). State variables in both the condensate film and the diffusion layer were solved separately and the condensation interface was used to couple the two solutions. The solution of the condensate film was obtained using well-established solutions of laminar film condensation of pure vapor. In contrast to other models surveyed, this work provides a inexpensive and accurate predictions of heat and mass transfer characteristics. We validated the work against two classical condensation problems. The model was first validated against empirical correlations and experimental work, resulting in a very good agreement. We then assessed the applicability of ignoring the condensate film effect, as performed in previous models, on the condensation processes by observing the thermal resistances of both the condensate film and diffusion layer. Results indicated that for the studied cases of NCG mass fractions above 20%, the condensate thermal resistance was at least an order of magnitude lower than that of the diffusion layer. However, the two thermal resistances seem to approach each other as NCG mass fraction becomes smaller. On another front, we observed that models that ignore the condensate film thermal resistance underestimate the interfacial temperature albeit accurately predicting the overall heat transfer rate. To simulate even lower NCG mass fractions, we validated our model to the classical analytical work of Sparrow and co-workers. Results showed a striking agreement between the two solutions at different NCG mass fractions (0.5%-10%) and subcooling degrees (5 degrees F-40 degrees F). Finally, we found a good agreement between results of our model and the heat/mass transfer analogy. The heat/mass transfer analogy is a semi-empirical method therefore, is limited to the existing correlations and their uncertainties. On the other hand, our model does not use any empiricism and relies on the available solutions of laminar condensate film of pure vapor in predicting the liquid side heat transfer coefficient.

Excellent electrochemical stability, thermal consistency, reversibility and lower internal resistance were noted at various current densities when graphene oxide was electrochemically deposited on the surface of conducting polyaniline at +0.75 V. Electrochemical deposition of graphene oxide on the polyaniline was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, Raman scattering and UV/Vis spectroscopy measurements. The electrochemically deposited polyaniline-grafted graphene oxide is confirmed in various characterization techniques employed and has promising electrochemical features due to its good transparency and stability and hence can find various applications in the manufacture of electronic materials and in the construction of electrochemical sensors that are cheap, simple and environmental friendly.|| The optoelectrical and magnetic characteristics of naturally existing iron-based nanostructures, especially hematite and magnetite nanoparticles (H-NPs and M-NPs), gained significant research interest in various applications, recently. The main purpose of this Review is to provide an overview of the utilization of H-NPs and M-NPs in various environmental remediation. Iron-based NPs are extensively explored to generate green energy from environmental friendly processes such as water splitting and CO2 conversion to hydrogen and low molecular weight hydrocarbons, respectively. The latter part of the Review provided a critical overview to use H-NPs and M-NPs for the detection and decontamination of inorganic and organic contaminants to counter the environmental pollution and toxicity challenge, which could ensure environmental sustainability and hygiene. Some of the future perspectives are comprehensively presented in the final portion of the script, optimiztically, and it is supported by some relevant literature surveys to predict the possible routes of H-NPs and M-NPs modifications that could enable researchers to use these NPs in more advanced environmental applications. The literature collection and discussion on the critical assessment of reserving the environmental sustainability challenges provided in this Review will be useful not only for experienced researchers but also for novices in the field.|| Ovarian cancer is a highly aggressive disease which is treated by surgery and platinum chemotherapy. However, a significant proportion of treated patients develop resistance to platinum treatment resulting in tumor relapse. Acquired platinum resistance has been recently correlated with activation of pro-survival endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses. We hypothesized that Au complexes that induce severe ER stress might counteract pro-survival cellular attempts leading to the ER stress-mediated apoptosis and reduced platinum resistance. In this work, we prepared a series of highly cytotoxic Au-I-dialkyldithiocarbamate complexes and investigated their anticancer potential in ovarian cancer cells. Complexes demonstrated surprisingly low stability in chloroform, resulting in the formation of an Au chain polymer, which also displayed excellent cytotoxicity. Lead complex2induced oxidative stress and ER stress-mediated p53-independent apoptosis associated with PARP cleavage and cell cycle arrest at G(2)/M phase. Importantly,2caused the surface exposure of calreticulin (CRT), which is the first step in the activation of cellular immunogenic response.|| Polymers based on methacrylates bearing short oligo(ethylene glycol) side parts constitute a modern class of stimuli-responsive, biocompatible materials exhibiting several important biological applications. A study of their polymerization kinetics considering also the effect of functional (such as hydroxyl) groups in the macromolecular chain is very important in order to set the appropriate reaction parameters (such as time, temperature,etc.). The materials investigated were based on oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate with 4-5 ethylene oxide units, POEGMMA(300)and oligo(ethylene glycol) hydroxyethyl methacrylate with nearly 5 ethylene oxide units and a terminal hydroxyl group, POEGHEMA. Experimental data on their bulk radical polymerization were collected under both isothermal and non-isothermal reaction conditions and compared with the corresponding data from polymers without PEG units. An appropriate theoretical model was also developed taking into account the effect of diffusion controlled phenomena on the reaction kinetic rate constants and used to simulate the experimental data over the whole conversion range. From the experimental data the term that combines the kinetic rate coefficients of the propagation and termination reaction,i.e. k(p)(2)/k(t), was evaluated. It was found that these values increase with the increasing size of the ester group for both POEGMMA(300)compared to PMMA and POEGHEMA compared to PHEMA. The presence of the hydroxyl group in POEGHEMA resulted in a higher polymerization rate compared to POEGMMA(300). In contrast, verifying similar literature findings, the effective activation energy, as well as the activation energies of the propagation and termination reactions were found not to be significantly affected by the presence of the side groups. Furthermore, the presence of the hydroxyl groups leads to slightly higher critical free volumes for the onset of the gel- and glass-effect, meaning an earlier effect of the diffusion-controlled phenomena on both the termination and propagation reactions. Using appropriate equations correlating all parameters with temperature, the predictive capabilities of the model were tested in non-isothermal runs and the simulation of the experimental data was found to be very good. Depropagation reactions were not found to play a significant role, since all non-isothermal experiments were completed at temperatures less than 120 degrees C, below the ceiling temperature of the systems.|| Combining optical properties with flexibility in organic crystals may find promising applications in optical waveguides, flexible optoelectronics, etc. We describe a family of halogen-substituted benzothiazole compounds which grow with an acicular needle morphology based on a slip-stacked supramolecular assembly sustained by a series of noncovalent interactions, including halogen bonds etc. Some of them comply with necessary packing features for elasticity; therefore, bending-relaxation cycles can be repeated several times. As these compounds are fluorescent in nature, the optical properties can be gainfully combined with flexibility toward achieving a new class of crystalline materials for optical waveguides and flexible optoelectronics.|| Functional polymers have attached attention in recent years due to their wide applications and unique properties such as sound sensitivity, electrical, catalytic activity, etc for analysis pollutants. The synthesis of functionalized polymers can be affected by several factors, such as the polymerization process, the composition of polymers, and functionalization. However, the scaling-up process from laboratory to industrial is still limited due to its matrix process and steps. We have discussed: i) types of nanostructures and polymer functionalizations, ii) the analytical performance of the functionalized polymers for the analysis of pollutants like toxic gas, pesticide residues, heavy metal, and aromatic compounds, iii) the design and simple concept of the scaling-up process, iv) a parameter affecting the scaling-up process of the synthesis and application of the functionalized polymer nanostructures for the analysis of pollutants. This review will help industry experts and researchers with developing the analysis. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The nanoparticles considered are aluminium nitride (AlN), silicon nitride (Si3N4) and titanium nitride (TiN). The proposed model was built using simple and easy-toobtain inputs such as the size of the nanoparticles (20, 30, 50, and 80 nm), the molar mass of the nanoparticles, mass fraction of nanoparticles (0.01 - 0.1) and the temperature (288.15 K, 298.15 K, and 308.15 K). Our suggested model showed better prediction accuracy over the analytical models for the estimation of specific heat capacity of nitrides/ethylene glycol nanofluids. Given the simplicity of the model inputs and the accuracy of the model, the approach presented provides a more reliable prediction of specific heat capacity of nitrides-ethylene glycol-based nanofluids than previous models.|| Phosphane gold(I) complexes, [Au(ACP)Cl] (1) and [Au(ACP)(S2CNR2)] (2-4) where ACP = 2-(diphenyl-phosphanyl)-1-aminocyclohexane or (2-aminocyclohexyl)diphenylphosphane, and R = methyl, ethyl, benzyl, were synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. The molecular structure of one of the compounds, [Au(ACP)Cl] (1), was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, which revealed a linear geometry around the Au(I) center. The crystal structure is stabilized by N-H center dot center dot center dot Cl hydrogen bonding interactions. The in vitro cytotoxicity of the complexes was evaluated against three cancer cells, A549 (human lung cancer), HeLa (human cervical cancer) and HepG2 (human liver cancer) cell lines. Three of the four complexes showed excellent in vitro cytotoxicity; their inhibition effect is much greater than that of cisplatin. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Suzuki-Miyaura reactions of 3,4-dibromo-1-methyl-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione with two equivalents of arylboronic acids gave vicinal diphenyl-substituted maleimide products. The reaction with one equivalent of arylboronic acid resulted in site-selective synthesis of N-methyl-2-aryl-3-bromomaleimide. The one-pot reaction of 3,4-dibromo-1-methyl-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione with two different arylboronic acids afforded N-methyl-2-3-diaryl-maleimides containing two different aryl groups. Maleimide-resulting compounds have added a general interest in the fields of Pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, materials and catalysis. The synthesis of maleimide-substituted compounds via Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling protocols has increased extensive interest in the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds.|| The effect of embedding various metal oxide additives on the structural, curing, morphological, adhesion, and corrosion protection properties of a novel hybrid sol-gel polymeric coating has been examined using various characterization techniques. The coating formulation embedded with yttrium(III) oxide exhibited optimum low surface roughness, good adhesion to metallic substrates with elevated thermal stability, and enhanced barrier properties for mild steel substrates in 3.5 wt.% NaCl medium compared to the parent coating. Scanning electrochemical microscopy analyses indicated a dense, crack-free, and homogeneous nature for the coating layer on the steel. The coating's degradation was evaluated using the scanning electrochemical microscopic technique.|| Bridged N,N '-substituted bisbenzimidazolium bromide salts (L1, L2, and L3) were synthesized and fully characterized. Reactions of palladium acetate with L1, L2, and L3 afforded corresponding new bridged bis(N-heterocyclic carbene)palladium(II) complexes (C1, C2, and C3) in high yields. The X-ray structure of complex C1 showed that the Pd(II) ion is bonded to the two carbon atoms of the bis(N-heterocyclic carbene) and two bromido ligands are in the cis position, resulting in a distorted square planar geometry. The three Pd(NHC)(2)Br-2 complexes C1, C2, and C3 were evaluated in carbonylative Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reactions of aryl boronic acids with aryl halides and displayed high catalytic activity with low catalyst loading. The coupling reactions of aryl bromides were selective towards the carbonylation product at higher carbon monoxide pressure.|| The luminous efficiency of inorganic white light-emitting diodes, to be used by the next generation as light initiators, is continuously progressing and is an emerging interest for researchers. However, low color-rendering index (Ra), high correlated color temperature (CCT), and poor stability limit its wider application. Herein, it is reported that Sm3+- and Eu3+-doped calcium scandate (CaSc2O4 (CSO)) are an emerging deep-red-emitting material with promising light absorption, enhanced emission properties, and excellent thermal stability that make it a promising candidate with potential applications in emission display, solid-state white lighting, and the device performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The average crystal structures of Sm3+-doped CSO are studied by synchrotron X-ray data that correspond to an extremely rigid host structure. Samarium ion is incorporated as a sensitizer that enhances the emission intensity up to 30%, with a high color purity of 88.9% with a 6% increment. The impacts of hosting the sensitizer are studied by quantifying the lifetime curves. The CaSc2O4:0.15Eu(3+),0.03Sm(3+) phosphor offers significant resistance to thermal quenching. The incorporation of lanthanide ion-doped phosphors CSOE into PSCs is investigated along with their potential applications. The CSOE-coated PSCs devices exhibit a high current density and a high power conversion efficiency (15.96%) when compared to the uncoated control devices.|| A composite of zeolite Y type -graphene as a support doped with molybdenum-cobalt and molybdenum-nickel (active phase and promoter) was synthesized and evaluated as hydrodesulfurization (HDS) catalysts. The ZGMoCo was found to have the ability to reduce the sulfur content by approximate to 98 % after a 5 h reaction time which is higher compared to the ZMoCo or ZMoNi. This activity can be ascribed to the improved surface area and better distribution of the active phases (molybdenum and cobalt or nickel) on the zeolite Y type -graphene surface. SEM images showed enhanced dispersion of the active phases on the support surface. As per the BET measurements, the surface area was improved due to the introduction of graphene to be 323.6 m(2)/g ZGMoCo compared to 257.3 m(2)/g ZMoCo; and 312.5 m(2)/g for ZGMoNi compared to 245.7 m(2)/g for ZMoNi. The work offers a convenient approach to prepare an effective HDS catalyst.|| This study aims to research the adsorption of Nd+3, Tb+3, and Dy+3 from aqueous media onto the magnetic calcium alginate/carboxymethyl chitosan/Ni0.2Zn0.2F2.6O4 (CA/CMC/Ni0.2Zn0.2F2.6O4) bionanocomposite in a single system. FE-SEM, FT-lR, EDX, VSM, and TGA were applied to characterize the product. The VSM result showed the saturation magnetization values of 45.87 and 14.14 emu/g for the bare Ni0.2Zn0.2F2.6O4 nanopartides and CA/CMC/Ni0.2Zn0.2F2.6O4, respectively. The adsorption results showed that at optimum conditions of contact time of 40 min, pH of 5.5, and 0.8 g/L, the adsorption efficiency of the adsorbent for Nd+3, Tb+3, and Dy+3 was 97.75, 96.83. and 97.85%, respectively. The ions adsorption kinetic onto the CA/CMC/Ni0.2Zn0.2F2.6O4 was in accordance with pseudo-second-order (PSO) model. The evaluation of equilibrium data was performed by the isotherm models of Langmuir and Freundlich. Fitting the experimental data of Tb+3 and Dy+3 was done better with Freunlich model than Langmuir model, while fitting tests for Nd+3 adsorption data showed better coverage using Langmuir model with a maximum adsorption capacity of 73.37 mg/g. The results of the parameters of thermodynamic showed the endothermic and spontaneous properties of the process. Additionally, the efficacy of the adsorbent was studied using 0.2 M HNO(3 )in four adsorptions-desorption cycles. Overall, the obtained results demonstrated that the environmentally friendly magnetic bionanocomposite adsorbent can be applied effectively for Nd+3, Tb+3, and Dy+3 adsorption with favorable adsorption efficiency.

The structural architect of TAZDPA contains 2,2'-dipicolylamine (DPA) and 1,2,3-triazolyl moiety as chelators, which synergistically coordinate with Zn2+, resulting in dramatic fluorescent emission enhancement and a notable bathochromic shift due to the inhibition of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process. Solution state structural characterization and molecular modeling of TAZDPA suggest that N3 of 1,2,3-triazolyl moiety and DPA coordinate with Zn2+ to afford five-membered coordination ring. The binding behavior and stoichiometry of the TAZDPA/Zn(2+)complex was studied by Job's plot, which suggested 1 : 1 stoichiometry. The nature of binding behavior of TAZDPA with Zn2+ was validated by H-1-NMR that revealed a distinct downfield shift of DPA and triazolyl protons. Under physiological condition, TAZDPA displayed high selectivity for Zn2+ over a wide range of competing common cations, exhibiting ultra-sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) of 8.3x10(1) nM. This implies that TAZDPA can detect chronic Zn2+ concentration for freshwater (>1.84 mu M) denoted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).|| Herein, graphene oxide (GO) was chemically functionalized with polyethyleneimine (PEI) in a single step to obtain PEI-GO, which was characterized via FTIR spectroscopy, SEM, and TEM. Additionally, for the first time, PEI-GO was employed for the corrosion mitigation of carbon steel in a solution of 15% HCl. The corrosion performance of the inhibitor was evaluated by utilizing weight loss tests, electrochemical measurements with impedance analysis, electrochemical frequency modulation, and potentiodynamic polarization studies. Thorough surface analysis was performed using 3D profilometry and static water contact angle measurements. PEI-GO was adsorbed on the steel surface and showed mixed-type corrosion inhibition behavior with the prevalence of cathodic characteristics. Additionally, potassium iodide was incorporated in the acid solution as a synergistic agent to enhance the corrosion inhibition behavior of PEI-GO. The obtained results showed that PEI-GO alone provided a high corrosion inhibition efficiency of 88.24% at a temperature of 65 degrees C and in the presence of KI, it showed an I.E. of 95.77% due to their synergistic effect. These interesting results demonstrate that PEI-GO can act as a potential corrosion inhibitor in acidizing conditions. The DFT-based computational studies showed that the inhibitor functioned in both its neutral and protonated forms.|| nan|| A novel hyper-cross-linked polyamide resin (PSI-PA) has been synthesized for the ultrahigh removal of Congo red (CR) and Eriochrom Black T (EBT) from aqueous solution. The mesoporous resin, having a specific surface area (98.80 m(2) g(-1)), showed maximum adsorption capacity (Q(max)) of 522.18 mg g(-1) for CR (pH 9.0) and 460.34 mg g(-1) for EBT (pH 6) at room temperature. The adsorption of these dyes was rapid and the equilibrium was attained within 4 h. The kinetic data was well-fitted by pseudo-second-order rate equation. Analysis of the surface chemical composition of loaded PSI-PA by XPS revealed the appearance of a new peak at around 166.0 eV (S 2p), confirming the adsorption of the sulfur-based dyes onto the resin. Examination of experimental data of dyes adsorption by a variety of non-linear adsorption isotherms and kinetic models suggested that the Langmuir model exhibited the best fit with high correlation coefficients for both CR (R-2 = 0.9966) and EBT (R-2 = 0.9934). PSI-PA has been extensively characterized by FT-IR, solid state C-13 (CP-MAS) NMR, EDS, TGA and BET analysis. Moreover, PSI-PA exhibited 82% removal efficiency for dyes in simulated effluents, mani-festing its promise and utility for treating industrial effluent.|| Sulfonated homo and co- polyimide (sPI) were synthesized with new compositional ratios, and used as additives (0.5wt%, 0.75wt%, and 1.0wt%) to prepare blend membranes with polysulfone (PSf). Flat sheet membranes for ultrafiltration (UF) were casted using the phase inversion technique. Surface morphology of the prepared UF membranes were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Surface charge of the membranes were determined by zeta potential, and hydrophilicity was studied by contact angle measurement. The contact angle of the membrane decreased with increasing sPI additive indicates increasing the hydrophilicity of the blend membranes. Filtration studies were conducted for rejection of heavy metals (Pb2+ and Cd2+) and proteins (pepsin and BSA). Blend membranes showed better rejection than pure PSf membrane. Among the blend membranes it was observed that with increasing amount of sPIs enhance the membrane properties and finally, PSf-sPI5 membrane with 1wt% of sPI5 showed the improved permeability (72.1Lm(-2) h(-1) bar(-1)), and the best rejection properties were found for both metal ions (approximate to 98% of Pb2+; approximate to 92% of Cd2+) and proteins (>98% of BSA;>86% of Pepsin). Over all, this membrane was having better hydrophilicity, porosity and higher number of sites to attach the metal ions. Its performance was even better than several-reported sulfonic acid based UF membranes. All these intriguing properties directed this new UF membrane for its potential application in wastewater treatment.|| Zeolite (Z) doped carbon nanofiber (CNF) was prepared as a support for amolybdenum(Mo) based catalyst and cobalt (Co) or nickel (Ni) were used as a promoter. The catalytic behavior of the synthesized catalyst zeolite-CNF/-MoCo (ZFMoCo) or zeolite-CNF/-MoNi (ZFMoNi) was evaluated for the hydrodesulfurization (HDS)reaction of dibenzo-thiophene (DBT) and compared with the catalyst without CNF (ZMoNi and ZMoCo). A set of characterizations were used to illustrate the physico-chemical properties of the catalyst. The catalytic activity of the catalyst was compared to the reference catalyst without CNF, and it was found that CNF has an effective role in improving the activity for sulfur removal from 90% (ZMoNi) to 95% (ZFMoNi) and from 92% (ZMoCo) to 98% (ZFMoCo). This could be due to the enhancement in the surface area after doping the CNF. Increasing the area for the dispersion of the active phase on the composite support surface (Z-CNF) showed higher catalytic performance.

Therefore, controlling the corrosion of metals is an important activity of technical, economical, environmental, and aesthetical importance in order to save huge expenses in materials, equipment, and structure. The use of corrosion inhibitors is one of the best options for controlling the metallic corrosion in various corrosive media. Numerous problems aroused with the use of inorganic and small molecule organic corrosion inhibitors, and the use of polymeric corrosion inhibitors came into limelight. This review article provides an overview of the recent development of different classes of corrosion inhibitors with special emphasis on different functional motifs of natural, synthetically modified natural, and synthetic polymeric materials. The significance, mechanism, and challenges of using polymeric materials as corrosion inhibitors are also highlighted in the review.|| A series of catalysts of cobalt (Co) and molybdenum (Mo) loaded on zeolite (Z) support decorated with different weight percent of activated carbon (AC), namely ZMoCo, ZACMoCo25%, ZACMoCo50%, and ZACMoCo75%, were newly prepared, characterized by using various techniques to reveal the structural, textural, surface composition and thermal behavior of both hybrid supports and supported bimetallic catalysts, followed by the evaluation of the supported bimetallic catalysts in ultra-deep hydrodesulfurization reaction. The loading of Co and Mo nanoparticles, as well as carbon, perturbed the zeolite lattice, but the structural crystallinity was largely preserved with low weight percent composition of carbon in the hybrid supports. The ZAC75% hybrid support showed significant loss of crystallinity, but this seemed to be largely redeemed with the incorporation of Co and Mo nanoparticles, as in the case of ZACMoCo75%. The progressive decrease in relative crystallinity (RC) with an increase in the amount of carbon, in both hybrid supports and supported bimetallic catalysts, could be due to the dilution effect of the hybrid supports. Importantly, the decoration of Y zeolite with carbon from waste rubber tyre offered a new metal-free approach to modify zeolite support for hydrodesulfurization MoCo catalysts. Optimum loading of carbon onto zeolite support offered uniform mesoporous structure, moderate acidity, and better active metal dispersion in the carbon-decorated zeolite-supported MoCo catalysts. The hybrid support ZAC50% showed better dispersion of metal nanoparticles to form ZACMoCo50% with preserved structural, textural and surface functionalities and reduced acidity that enabled its better performance of 98% conversion (turn over number, TON, of 7.84 at 6 h reaction time) in hydrodesulfurization of model fuel.|| Herein, we report the expedient synthesis of new nanocomposite Sn0.39Ti0.61O2 center dot TiO2 flakes using simple sol-gel and calcination methods. In order to prepare this material, first, we generated a polymeric gel using cost-effective and easily accessible precursors such as SnCl4, titanium isopropoxide, and tetrahydrofuran (THF). A small amount of triflic acid was used to initiate THF polymerization. The calcination of the resulting gel at 500 degrees C produced a Sn-Ti bimetallic nanocomposite. This newly synthesized Sn0.39Ti0.61O2 center dot TiO2 was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and UV-visible spectroscopy. The photoelectrochemical (PEC) studies were performed for the first time using Sn0.39Ti0.61O2 center dot TiO2 coated over fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) under simulated 1 sun solar radiation. The chronoamperometric study of the Sn0.39Ti0.61O2 center dot TiO2/FTO revealed the repeatable and substantially higher photocurrent for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) when compared to only TiO2. Moreover, the synthesized material exhibited high stability both in the presence and absence of light. The photocatalytic studies suggested that the sol-gel-synthesized Sn0.39Ti0.61O2 center dot TiO2 can be efficiently used as a photoanode in the water-splitting reaction.|| Scale formation on surfaces in contact with water supersaturated with calcium carbonate creates technical problems, including heat transfer hindrance, energy consumption, and equipment shutdown. Thus, nowadays, there is an increasing need for new approaches that are environmentally friendly and economically feasible. In this work, for the first time, calcium carbonate growth was investigated using UV light exposure, and the growth rate was compared with control and commercial antiscalant. Saturated calcium carbonate samples were exposed to UV radiation; the growth rate of calcium carbonate crystals was monitored at different time intervals. Results clearly show that about 85% decrease in crystal growth rate was observed when compared to 43% after the addition of 3 mg/L of amino tris(methylene phosphonic acid) antiscalant. Calcium carbonate scale deposition on hydrophobic and hydrophilic membranes was investigated. The amount of scale deposited in the case of a UV-treated sample is insignificant when compared to control samples. Thus, the exposure of UV might help to improve the membranes' lifetime. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy analyses revealed that UV light treatment produced mostly calcite crystals. The produced calcites are less dense and less adherent, and it can be easily removable when compared to other types of calcium carbonate phases. Thus, UV radiation is an efficient green approach for calcium carbonate scale mitigation on membrane surfaces.|| Activated carbon (AC) was first produced from waste rubber tires via pyrolysis and then tested for its ability to adsorb chloromethanes from aqueous solutions. The adsorption activity of the AC was facilitated by the existence of carboxyl and hydroxyl functionalities on its surface. Under optimal conditions (AC dosage of 5 g/L and contact time of 60 min), 86.9% dichloromethane, 98.1% chloroform, and 99.8% carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) were removed from the contaminated water. The adsorption experimental data were fitted to the kinetics and the adsorption isotherms models. The density functional theory approach was adopted to assess the various possibilities of interaction between CCl4 and the functionalized AC. Theoretical modeling predicted the adsorption activity to be predominantly controlled by a hydrogen-bonding-assisted Cl center dot center dot center dot O=C type of interaction. In addition, the adsorption was found to be facilitated by various types of pi center dot center dot center dot Cl interactions, with the development of an appreciable charge transfer during the process. This theoretical modeling of the interaction between AC and the organic contaminants is an improvement of our previous studies on the adsorption of contaminants using cost-effective AC.|| Sulfur-containing compounds are the most abundant compounds in crude oil. Sulfur in liquid fuel oil leads to the emission of sulfur oxides and sulfate particulate matter which not only endangers health and community property but also reduces the life of the catalysts and engines due to corrosion. Various methods, with a high level of precision and sensitivity, have been developed to analyze sulfur-containing compounds. On the other side, the removal and characterization of sulfur-containing compounds in crude oils and petroleum products is of great importance, not only for the downstream refining process, control/optimization, and environmental compliance, but also for upstream geochemical studies for exploration and production. This review summarizes the analytical strategies and some of the most important and promising technologies for the removal of sulfur from oil. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In this research, nitrogen-modified porous carbon materials with varying ratio of carbon-melamine (1:1, 1:2 and 1:3) were synthesized from a sustainable and green-initiated feedstock, sugarcane bagasse, and solid-state impregnation of melamine and investigated as alternative sorbent in CO2 capture. This gives an insight into the effect of increasing the nitrogen content of porous carbon material on CO2 capture. The CO2 uptake of the nitrogen-modified carbon was at least 35% more than that of the pristine porous carbon. Modified carbon with carbon-melamine ratio (1:2) demonstrates the highest CO2 uptake at ambient pressure and temperature (3.34 mmol/g), making it comparable to similar materials that have been reported. The superiority demonstrated by this adsorbent was attributed to a balance between its textural properties and chemical functionalization using nitrogen. The synthesized material also showed high selectivity and regeneration capacities. Adsorption of CO2 and N-2 on pristine and nitrogen modified carbon material was also examined using density functional theory (DFT) calculation at B3LYP/6-31G (d) level. The result obtained revealed that nitrogen-doped carbon material exhibited higher tendency to CO2 adsorption than pristine carbon material in accordance with the hard-soft acid-base (HSAB) principle. This work provides a new and efficient route for the synthesis of nitrogen modified carbon and application for similar adsorption processes.|| The 3D architecture of Co(II) oxide (CoO) having oxygen defects has been recognized as a highly functional characteristic towards efficient electrocatalysis of water.

Different formulations based on different additives are prepared and pumped down into the annulus between casing and formation. In the past, sodium silicate and some other silicates had a wide range of applications in conformance control and water shutoff. Mostly silicate-based systems were used as extenders and accelerators in oil well cementing. In this study, a novel silicate system, aqueous alkali alumino silicate (AAAS) was tested in oil well cementing. There have been limited applications of an AAAS-based cement system reported in the literature. Nondestructive compressive strength and rheological properties such as plastic viscosity, yield point, and gel strengths of silicate-based cement slurries were measured. The AAAS was added in (3, 5, and 8) wt % (% by weight of water) into the cement slurry and cured at 50 degrees C and 2000 psi for 24 h in an ultrasonic cement analyzer. The evolution of compressive strength was measured with time. The rheological properties were measured at 50 degrees C and atmospheric pressure using an atmospheric viscometer. The performance of AAAS was compared with 5 wt % sodium silicate and simple Class G cement. The scratch strength of 5 wt % AAAS and sodium-silicate-based cement slurries were tested and compared. It was observed that the addition of a novel silicate system increased the compressive strength. In addition to that, the novel silicate provided an accelerating effect in the development of compressive strength. The rheological properties increased with an increase in concentration. The yield point was mainly affected by the addition of AAAS. The application of a novel silicate could be a strong alternative for sodium silicate in area of oil well cementing because of its promising results of compressive strength and rheology. It has a high tolerance toward contamination as compared to sodium silicate reported in the literature. The nondestructive compressive was increased by 33% upon the ddition of 5 wt % AAAS. Furthermore, AAAS increased the yield point from 15.94 to 24.64 lbf/100 ft(2) at 5 wt % concentration. The AAAS solution is preferable in shallow gas wells of depths less than 3000 feet and 60 degrees C temperature. In those wells, AAAS can be pumped along with cement slurry for its quick setting. The AAAS can also be applied as an extender during cementing of low breakdown pressure formation or depleted zones.|| The swelling of shale formation upon exposure to water-based drilling fluids leads to several problems. Common shale (clay) inhibitors used in the industry have several shortcomings which adversely affect the drilling mud properties. This study involves the development, application, and mechanism of new quaternary ammonium gemini cationic surfactants as clay swelling inhibitors. These gemini surfactants are structurally similar but different in terms of the spacer lengths. The inhibition characteristics of gemini surfactants were evaluated using a linear swell tester, capillary suction timer, scanning electron microscope (SEM), rheology, filtration, wettability, and zeta potential analysis. It was observed that the new gemini cationic surfactants with various lengths of spacers reduced the clay swelling. The GS12 surfactant, containing flexible large spacer C12 proved to be a beneficial swelling inhibitor as compared to GS8 and GS10 due to increased hydrophobicity. It also showed acceptable performance compared to the common shale inhibitor used in the industry. SEM images revealed that water caused significant damage to clay structures showing irregular and sharp edges. However, the surfactant-treated clay showed a fine, dense, and smooth surface. An inhibition mechanism using synthesized surfactants was also proposed. Experimental tests showed the synthesized surfactants adsorb and intercalate between layers of clay through hydrogen bonding and attractive electrostatic forces. The orientation of lipophilic tails inhibits the water adsorption in the clay which results in reduced clay swelling. The synthesized surfactants reduced the clay swelling without affecting the other mud properties such as rheology, stability, and filtration properties. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.|| Hematite (Fe2O3) is used as a weighting material to increase the density of the drilling fluid. Hematite has a higher density (5.05 g/cm(3)) compared with barite (4.2 g/cm(3)). Because of the high specific gravity and particle size, hematite can separate and settle down at higher temperatures (> 250 degrees F). The objective of this paper is to assess the usage of laponite which is synthetic layered silicate to solve the settling of hematite particles in water-based mud (WBM). Laponite was added to the WBM in different concentrations 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 lb./bbl. Static and dynamic sag tests were performed to determine the optimum quantity of laponite. The viscoelastic and rheology properties were evaluated to compare between WBM-blank and WBM-laponite. The filtration test was performed at 250 degrees F and 300-psi pressure difference to assess the effect of adding laponite on the filter cake thickness and filtration volume. The results showed that adding 1 lb./bbl of laponite was enough to eliminate the sag issue in both vertical and 45 degrees inclination. The sag factor was reduced from 0.594 to 0.502 at the vertical condition and from 0.62 to 0.51 for the 45 degrees inclined condition. For the dynamic sag, the viscometer sag shoe test (VSST) decreased from 2.1 to 0.21 lb./gal after adding 1 lb./bbl of laponite. It was observed that the apparent viscosity (AV) and yield point (YP) increased by 16% and 33% after adding 1 lb./bbl of the laponite respectively, while there was no change in plastic viscosity (PV) which resulted in increasing the YP/PV ratio which is a good indication of fluid stability and better hole cleaning performance. For the filtration properties, there was no significant change in filter cake thickness and filtration volume.|| The rock geomechanical properties are the key parameters for designing the drilling and fracturing operations and for programing the geomechanical earth models. During drilling, the horizontal-section drilling fluids interact with the reservoir rocks in different exposure time, and to date, there is no comprehensive work performed to study the effect of the exposure time on the changes in sandstone geomechanical properties. The objective of this paper is to address the exposure time effect on sandstone failure parameters such as unconfined compressive strength, tensile strength, acoustic properties, and dynamic elastic moduli while drilling horizontal sections using barite-weighted water-based drilling fluid. To simulate the reservoir conditions, Buff Berea sandstone core samples were exposed to the drilling fluid (using filter press) under 300 psi differential pressure and 200 degrees F temperature for different exposure times (up to 5 days). The rock characterization and geomechanical parameters were evaluated as a function of the exposure time. Scratch test was implemented to evaluate rock strength, while ultrasonic pulse velocity was used to obtain the sonic data to estimate dynamic elastic moduli. The rock characterization was accomplished by X-ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance, and scanning electron microscope. The study findings showed that the rock compression and tensile strengths reduced as a function of exposure time (18% and 19% reduction for tensile strength and unconfined compression strength, respectively, after 5 days), while the formation damage displayed an increasing trend with time. The sonic results demonstrated an increase in the compressional and shear wave velocities with increasing exposure time. All the dynamic elastic moduli showed an increasing trend when extending the exposure time except Poisson's ratio which presented a constant behavior after 1 day. Nuclear magnetic resonance results showed 41% porosity reduction during the five days of mud interaction. Scanning electron microscope images showed that the rock internal surface topography and internal integrity changed with exposure time, which supported the observed strength reduction and sonic variation. A new set of empirical correlations were developed to estimate the dynamic elastic moduli and failure parameters as a function of the exposure time and the porosity with high accuracy.|| Rate of penetration (ROP) is defined as the amount of removed rock per unit area per unit time. It is affected by several factors which are inseparable. Current established models for determining the ROP include the basic mathematical and physics equations, as well as the use of empirical correlations. Given the complexity of the drilling process, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) has been a game changer because most of the unknown parameters can now be accounted for entirely at the modeling process. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the ability of the optimized adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), functional neural networks (FN), random forests (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) models to predict the ROP in real time from the drilling parameters in the S-shape well profile, for the first time, based on the drilling parameters of weight on bit (WOB), drillstring rotation (DSR), torque (T), pumping rate (GPM), and standpipe pressure (SPP). Data from two wells were used for training and testing (Well A and Well B with 4012 and 1717 data points, respectively), and one well for validation (Well C) with 2500 data points. Well A and Well B data were combined in the training-testing phase and were randomly divided into a 70:30 ratio for training/testing. The results showed that the ANFIS, FN, and RF models could effectively predict the ROP from the drilling parameters in the S-shape well profile, while the accuracy of the SVM model was very low. The ANFIS, FN, and RF models predicted the ROP for the training data with average absolute percentage errors (AAPEs) of 9.50%, 13.44%, and 3.25%, respectively. For the testing data, the ANFIS, FN, and RF models predicted the ROP with AAPEs of 9.57%, 11.20%, and 8.37%, respectively. The ANFIS, FN, and RF models overperformed the available empirical correlations for ROP prediction. The ANFIS model estimated the ROP for the validation data with an AAPE of 9.06%, whereas the FN model predicted the ROP with an AAPE of 10.48%, and the RF model predicted the ROP with an AAPE of 10.43%. The SVM model predicted the ROP for the validation data with a very high AAPE of 30.05% and all empirical correlations predicted the ROP with AAPEs greater than 25%.|| Condensate-liquid accumulation in the vicinity of a well is known to curtail gas production up to 80%. Numerous approaches are employed to mitigate condensate banking and improve gas productivity. In this work, a field-scale simulation is presented for condensate damage removal in tight reservoirs using a thermochemical treatment strategy where heat and pressure are generated in situ. The impact of thermochemical injection on the gas recovery is also elucidated. A compositional simulator was utilized to assess the effectiveness of the suggested treatment on reducing the condensate damage and, thereby, improve the gas recovery. Compared to the base case, represented by an industry-standard gas injection strategy, simulation studies suggest a significantly improved hydrocarbon recovery performance upon thermochemical treatment of the near-wellbore zone. For the scenarios investigated, the application of thermochemicals allowed for an extension of the production plateau from 104 days, as determined for the reference gas injection case, to 683 days. This represents a 6.5-fold increase in production plateau time, boosting gas recovery from 25 to 89%. The improved recovery is attributed to the reduction of both capillary pressure and condensate viscosity. The presented work is crucial for designing and implementing thermochemical treatments in tight-gas reservoirs.|| Porosity is one of the most important properties to be determined for evaluating hydrocarbon reservoirs. It represents the voids and empty volume inside the rock. This property is mostly obtained from well logs and/or laboratory experiments on core plugs or drilled cuttings. Despite the accuracy in the porosity values provided by these techniques, these methods are costly and time consuming. There is a need to relate the rock porosity to the drilling parameters since drilling process provides the initial insight to the formation. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in drilling applications is a game changer since most of the unknown parameters are accounted during the modeling process. The objective of this paper is to implement an artificial neural network (ANN) technique to predict the porosity in the reservoir section from the drilling parameters. The data used to build the ANN model are based on real field data (2,800 data points) that were obtained from two horizontal wells (i.e. Well A and Well B). The data from Well A were used to train and test the ANN model with a training/testing ratio of 70:30. More than 30 sensitivity analyses were performed to select the optimum ANN model's design parameters. Well B data were used to validate the developed ANN model. The obtained results showed that ANNs can be used effectively to predict the porosity from the drilling parameters in the reservoir section with an average correlation coefficient of appproximately 0.96 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of almost 0.018. The best ANN parameter combination was with two layers, 30 neurons per layer with Levenberg-Marquardt training function and tan-sigmoid as the transfer function. The validation process confirmed that the ANN porosity model was able to predict the porosity of Well B with a correlation coefficient of 0.907 and an RMSE of 0.035.|| This paper presents the performance of thermochemical treatment in removing the condensate banking from different formations. Results of coreflooding experiments and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements are thoroughly discussed. In this work, rock samples from sandstone, shale, and carbonate formations were used. Chemical solutions that can generate pressure and temperature at certain conditions were used. Coreflooding experiments were carried out using Huff and Puff injection mode, four cycles of injection and production phases were implemented. Sufficient soaking time was provided for all samples to ensure that the reaction between the injected fluids and the rock matrix is completed. The impact of formation type and injection cycles on the treatment performance is analyzed. The cumulative condensate recoveries are 72.97%, 68.09% and 43.37% for sandstone, carbonate, and shale samples, respectively. For all samples, more liquid removal was achieved during the first cycles of the chemical treatment. Moreover, coreflooding and NMR experiments indicate that the thermochemical fluids are compatible with the treated rocks and no formation damage was induced. The products of thermochemical reaction can stabilize the clay minerals and prevent clay swelling, fines migration and pore throat plugging. For shale rocks, thermochemical treatment showed better performance than gas injection in mitigating the condensate banking. At the same treatment conditions, thermochemical fluids increased the condensate removal by a factor of 1.7 compared to the cyclic methane injection. Overall, thermochemicals are very effective in removing condensate banking from shale, tight sandstone, and tight carbonate rocks.|| Many aerobic microorganisms can produce bio-surfactants which are capable of effectively reducing interfacial tensions between oil, water and rock. However, there are few publications on the production of bio-surfactants from anaerobic organisms. The combined effect of bio-surfactant, green surfactant and alcohol in the MEOR process, are not well understood yet and require further investigation. This experimental study was conducted to examine the effectiveness of combination of two microbial by-products, bio-surfactant and bio-alcohol, in recovering residual oil within the pores of rock. It also considered whether bio-surfactant capability could be improved by blending it with non-ionic green surfactant. Two formulations of surfactant and co-surfactant mixtures were selected for core-flood experiments based on phase behaviour study and IFT reduction to examine their potential for enhanced oil recovery. In the first formulation, JF-2 bio-surfactant was mixed with butanol; it was found that this formulation did not produce a significant quantity of incremental oil after water flooding. Lastly, a bio-surfactant (anionic) was blended with non-ionic green surfactant alkyl polyglucoside and butanol; this produced about 25% tertiary oil and 64% OIIP.|| The mechanical properties of oil well cement slurry are usually measured to evaluate the durability, sustainability, and long-lasting behavior of a cement sheath under wellbore conditions. High-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) conditions affect the mechanical properties of cement slurry such as its strength, elasticity, and curing time. In this study, an organically modified montmorillonite nanoclay (NC) and silica flour (SF) materials are used to enhance the strength of the class G cement. Four different cement slurries with the addition of different concentrations of NC (1% and 2%) and SF (20%) in a class G cement were tested under temperatures ranging between 70 and 100 degrees C and pressure ranging between 1000 and 3000 psia. The slurries were prepared by maintaining a water to cement ratio of 0.44. All the slurries were cured for 24 h before any test was conducted. Extensive laboratory experiments were carried out to measure the compressive and tensile strength of cement slurries cured at HPHT conditions. Compressive strength was measured using unconfined compressive strength (UCS) tests, scratch tests, and ultrasonic cement analyzer (UCA). Tensile strength was measured using breakdown pressure tests and Brazilian disc test analysis. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and petrophysical analysis were also carried out to evaluate the performance of new cement additives at HPHT conditions. Results showed that the addition of organically modified NC and SF significantly increased the compressive and tensile strength of the class G cement slurry cured at HPHT conditions.|| Hydration of shale formation by water-based drilling fluids leads to several problems, such as the collapse of boreholes, tight holes, and stuck pipe, which may impede further drilling and time loss in rectifying the problems, leading to heavy economic losses. This study reports the development of new gemini cationic surfactants as shale-swelling inhibitors. These gemini surfactants are structurally similar but differ in terms of the spacer group. Saturated butyl group (GS1) and unsaturated 2-butenyl (GS2) and 2-butynyl (GS3) were introduced as spacer groups of gemini surfactants. To assess the performance of new gemini cationic surfactants, two reliable clay sources were considered. The first clay is from an unconventional formation and the second clay is sodium bentonite. The inhibition characteristics of gemini surfactants were evaluated using dynamic swelling, hot rolling, rheology, and filtration experiments. Different formulations based on commercially available solutions for shale-swelling inhibitors were applied and compared with cationic shale inhibitors. It was observed that the new gemini cationic surfactants with different spacers (saturated and unsaturated) reduced the shale swelling by different percentages. The GS2 surfactant, containing an unsaturated double bond proved to be a good swelling inhibitor as compared to GS1 and GS3. It also showed acceptable performance compared with the common shale inhibitor (KCl) used in the industry. The addition of surfactant has less impact on the rheological properties as compared to KCl. The filtration properties of the base mud were unchanged when surfactants were used. However, the commercial inhibitor, KCl, significantly increased the filtration volume that is associated with the disintegration of the clay. In summary, unlike commercial inhibitors, the synthesized surfactants reduced the clay swelling without affecting the other properties of the drilling fluids.|| Effect of water fraction on the flow characteristics of water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions through porous medium has been investigated by experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Flooding experiments of W/O emulsions (E-1, E-2, E-3: water fraction, theta(w) (%v/v), = 11.8, 22, to 38%, respectively) and those of original oil (E-0, theta(w) = 0) were performed using a packed glass bead porous medium. The experimental information was used in building and validating a single-phase pore-scale flow model using the COMSOL Multiphysics 5.4 Software (base model). The simulated porosity (phi = 0.27) and absolute permeability (K-a = 74 mD) of the base model are in good agreement with those from the experiments (porosity phi = 0.30 and absolute permeability K-a = 68 mD). The simulated pressure drop and effective viscosity also compared fairly well with those obtained from the experiments (R-2 = 0.98; and 0.83, respectively). Ultimately, the CFD results show that the water fraction of W/O emulsion increased the viscosity, which subsequently increased the pressure drop. In addition, it was confirmed that the injection velocity and the pore size affect the flow characteristics in the porous medium.|| Nitrate (NO3-) represents one of the major groundwater constituents with increasing distribution and concentration in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This study aimed to determine potential sources of nitrate in the Early to Late Cretaceous Wasia aquifer system at the Al Kharj area (Central Saudi Arabia) by an integrative approach using groundwater geochemistry, nitrate isotopes (N-15-NO3 and O-18-NO3), and tritium (H-3) measurements. The lowest saline groundwater samples (TDS = 1400-2000 mg/L) from the peripheral zone were representative for pristine groundwater from the Wasia aquifer with nitrate concentrations below 20 mg/L and low O-18-NO3 ratios (8.7-20.6 parts per thousand) but enriched N-15-NO3 values (up to 10.8 parts per thousand). In contrast, 11 out of 34 analyzed water samples from irrigation wells and cattle watering wells exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) drinking water guideline value for nitrate of 50 mg/L with maximum concentrations of up to 395 mg/L. Nitrate fertilizers and atmospheric deposition are the main sources of nitrate in groundwater in the eastern and northern sections of the study area. The combination of elevated salinities (4940-7330 mg/L), NO3 (111-395 mg/L), boron (516-1430 mu g/L), and enriched O-18-NO3 (21.7-25.8 parts per thousand) ratios with depleted N-15-NO3 (5.7-7.6 parts per thousand) confirm the local influx of evaporated irrigation water with remnants of dissolved fertilizer into the Wasia groundwater system. There was no evidence for the influx of animal or human wastes from adjacent dairy, poultry, and housing infrastructures. Tritium concentrations below the detection limit of 0.8 TU for most borehole samples implied the absence of recent natural recharge. The estimated annual average N influx of 3.34 to 6.67 kg/ha to the Wasia aquifer requires a combination of atmospheric deposition and anthropogenic sources (mainly nitrate fertilizers) to increase the nitrogen content of the Wasia aquifer.|| Seismic waves in an attenuative porous medium are generally inhomogeneous waves, which have different directions of propagation and attenuation. The dissipation factors (1/Q) of inhomogeneous waves are strongly dependent on the degree of wave inhomogeneity and cannot be expressed correctly with the usual 1/Q expressions valid only for homogeneous waves. We have used the differing definitions of 1/Q for inhomogeneous waves (i.e., the ratio of the time-averaged dissipated energy density to the time-averaged strain energy density or time-averaged total energy density) and the complex form of the energy balance equations of poroviscoelastic media to derive concise and explicit expressions for the dissipation factors. They are given as simple functions of the material parameters and the wave inhomogeneity parameter for inhomogeneous SV-waves and fast and slow P-waves. The isotropic, poroviscoelastic medium under consideration is upscaled from effective Biot theory for a double-porosity solid, which is the most general theory to describe wave propagation in a reservoir. We find that, if the inhomogeneity parameter is infinite (i.e., the inhomogeneity angle is 90 degrees) for all three Biot waves, then the dissipation factors only depend on the ratio of the imaginary to the real part of the complex shear modulus. Our explicit expressions for the dissipation factors of poroviscoelastic materials also are reduced to obtain their counterparts for viscoelastic media as a special case. The inhomogeneous waves in an example poroviscoelastic material are used to demonstrate that the 1/Q values of the three Biot waves strongly depend on the inhomogeneity parameters and furthermore the different definitions may cause significant differences of 1/Q values. We find that the dissipation factor of fast P-waves may decrease with the increasing degree of inhomogeneity, which contradicts previously published results.|| High-bentonite mud (HBM) is a water-based drilling fluid characterized by its remarkable improvement in cutting removal and hole cleaning efficiency. Periodic monitoring of the rheological properties of HBM is mandatory for optimizing the drilling operation. The objective of this study is to develop new sets of correlations using artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the rheological parameters of HBM while drilling using the frequent measurements, every 15 to 20 min, of mud density (MD) and Marsh funnel viscosity (FV). The ANN models were developed using 200 field data points. The dataset was divided into 70:30 ratios for training and testing the ANN models respectively. The optimized ANN models showed a significant match between the predicted and the measured rheological properties with a high correlation coefficient (R) higher than 0.90 and a maximum average absolute percentage error (AAPE) of 6%. New empirical correlations were extracted from the ANN models to estimate plastic viscosity (PV), yield point (Y-P), and apparent viscosity (AV) directly without running the models for easier and practical application. The results obtained from AV empirical correlation outperformed the previously published correlations in terms of R and AAPE.|| Drilling depleted and ultra-deep gas reservoirs required special drilling fluids which should be capable of bridging along the walls of the well and withstands a high differential pressure. High-overbalanced water-based drilling fluid (HOBWBDF) is one of the most common drilling fluid used to drill the ultra-deep gas wells. Drilling fluids properties such as yield point (YP), plastic viscosity (PV), apparent viscosity (AV), flow behavior index (n) and consistency index (k) are very vital inputs in managing rig hydraulics, margins of surge and swab pressure, equivalent circulation density (ECD) and hole cleaning. There is a need to develop a new technique to estimate the rheological properties in real-time using the frequent measurements of mud density and Marsh funnel viscosity, which are carried out more frequently (every 15-20 min). The main goal beyond this work is to build novel empirical models that are capable of predicting the abovementioned rheological properties of high over-balanced water-based drilling fluid (HOBWBDF) in real-time for the first time. The models are built based on only two inputs which are the mud weight from the mud balance test and Marsh funnel viscosity measured by the Marsh funnel test. More than 1200 field measurements of rheological properties were used to feed an artificial neural network in order to develop new novel empirical models. The developed models using the ANN technique showed high accuracy for predicting the different drilling fluid rheological properties. The obtained results showed a maximum average absolute percentage error (AAPE) less than 8% with a correlation coefficient higher than 93%. The main advantages of these models are their inexpensiveness as there is no need for additional equipment to be added to the rig site. Moreover, these models would greatly help the drilling engineers to manage the ECD, surge and swab pressure and hole cleaning which in return will be reflected positively on the drilling performance.|| We address the management of invasive estuarine herbs providing some economic benefits and characterized by two modes of reproduction affecting the ecosystem. The study began by analyzing the stability of the plant dynamics using an approximate model resulting from the negligence of the seasonality in seedlings production. The optimal control seeks to find strategies with a minimal implementation cost by way of incorporating the plant profit in the payoff function. Optimal strategies were designed and implemented to control proliferation scenarios using a two-class compartmental model. Furthermore, the optimal control system was derived for the approximate model as well as for the model including the seasonality feature. Finally, numerical simulations were performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control laws for both systems. Recommendations for Resource Managers The quantification of the benefit of invasive estuarine herbs should be addressed in consultation with biologists, ecologists, and plant users. Data collection, for a robust empirical estimate of the model parameters, lasts for a year at least. The cutting-process is nonselective for the plant classes and the chemical treatment should be as minimal as possible. Management efforts should be more focused on the birth and death rates of plants.|| Visible-light and infrared-light persistent phosphors are extensively studied and are being used as self-sustained glowing tags in darkness. In contrast, persistent phosphors for higher-energy, solar-blind ultraviolet-C wavelengths (200-280nm) are lacking. Also, persistent tags working in bright environments are not available. Here we report five types of Pr3+-doped silicates (melilite, cyclosilicate, silicate garnet, oxyorthosilicate, and orthosilicate) ultraviolet-C persistent phosphors that can act as self-sustained glowing tags in bright environments. These ultraviolet-C persistent phosphors can be effectively charged by a standard 254nm lamp and emit intense, long-lasting afterglow at 265-270nm, which can be clearly monitored and imaged by a corona camera in daylight and room light. Besides thermal-stimulation, in bright environments, photo-stimulation also contributes to the afterglow emission and its contribution can be dominant when ambient light is strong. This study expands persistent luminescence research to the ultraviolet-C wavelengths and brings persistent luminescence applications to light. Ultraviolet-C radiation sources are important for disinfection and photochemical water purification, but development of persistent phosphors is needed for other applications. Here the authors report praseodymium-doped silicate ultraviolet-C persistent phosphors for self-sustained glowing tags in bright light.|| Weighting agents are mixed with the drilling mud to provide the high density required to control high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) wells throughout the drilling operation. Solids sag occurs when the weighting agent separates from the liquid phase and settles down, causing variations in the drilling fluid density. This study evaluates barite-manganese tetroxide (Micromax) mixture to eliminate solids sag issue encountered with weighted invert emulsion drilling fluids at HPHT conditions. Micromax additive was added to barite-weighted fluids in different concentrations, 0, 15, and 30 wt% of the total weighting agent. Static and dynamic sag tests were used to evaluate the sag tendency of the new formulation under static and dynamic conditions. The performance of the new formulation was evaluated by measuring the electrical stability, density, rheological, viscoelastic, and filtration properties of the drilling fluid.

4,Center of Research Excellence in Nanotechnology,Research Institue,175,1575,70,79,25,40.23,45.4,14.37,63.43,28.57,8,111,50,14,"|| High-performance, fluidizable VOx/Ce-meso-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by an excessive solvent approach. The prepared catalysts were characterized using various physicochemical techniques in order to secure desired properties. XRD, Raman, and FTIR analyses indicated the presence of amorphous VOx phases on Ce-meso-Al2O3. Nitrogen adsorption isotherm analysis confirmed a mesoporous framework with a high surface area of the catalysts. H-2-TPR reduction showed an active and stable behavior of the catalysts in repeated reduction and oxidation cycles. The NH3-TPD and NH3 desorption kinetics analysis revealed that the synthesized catalysts have moderate acidities and low activation energies of NH3 desorption, suggesting weak metal-support interactions. The VOx/Ce-meso-Al2O3 catalysts were evaluated for n-butane oxidative dehydrogenation (BODH) using a fluidized CREC riser simulator under gas-phase oxygen-free conditions. The reaction time and reaction temperature were varied between 5 and 25 s and 450-575 degrees C, respectively. It was found that BODH with 0.2 wt % cerium-doped VOx/meso-Al2O3 catalysts gives the highest selectivity (62.3%) of C4 olefins with a conversion of 10.6% at 450 degrees C and 5 s. Furthermore, the fluidizable VOx/Ce-meso-Al2O3 catalyst showed a stable performance over repeated feed injections followed by catalyst regeneration cycles for BODH.|| The optoelectrical and magnetic characteristics of naturally existing iron-based nanostructures, especially hematite and magnetite nanoparticles (H-NPs and M-NPs), gained significant research interest in various applications, recently. The main purpose of this Review is to provide an overview of the utilization of H-NPs and M-NPs in various environmental remediation. Iron-based NPs are extensively explored to generate green energy from environmental friendly processes such as water splitting and CO2 conversion to hydrogen and low molecular weight hydrocarbons, respectively. The latter part of the Review provided a critical overview to use H-NPs and M-NPs for the detection and decontamination of inorganic and organic contaminants to counter the environmental pollution and toxicity challenge, which could ensure environmental sustainability and hygiene. Some of the future perspectives are comprehensively presented in the final portion of the script, optimiztically, and it is supported by some relevant literature surveys to predict the possible routes of H-NPs and M-NPs modifications that could enable researchers to use these NPs in more advanced environmental applications. The literature collection and discussion on the critical assessment of reserving the environmental sustainability challenges provided in this Review will be useful not only for experienced researchers but also for novices in the field.|| A visible-light-active nickel oxide-graphitic carbon nitride (NiO@g-CN) hetero-structured nanocomposite was synthesized for the first time by pulsed laser ablation in liquid and used as a photoanode material in photoelectrochemical water-splitting reaction with a solar simulator. It was found that the photoelectrochemical performance of PLAL synthesized NiO@g-CN nanocomposite as photoanode, compared to g-CN as photoanode showed fourfold enhancements in photocurrent density under visible light. FT-IR, XRD, FE-SEM, and EDX consistently showed the proper anchoring of nano-sized NiO on g-CN. UV-DRS and the band gap estimation showed the narrowing down of the band gap energy and consequent enhancement in the visible-light absorption, whereas photoluminescence spectroscopy confirmed the reduction of the recombination of photo-excited electron hole pairs as a result of the anchoring of NiO on g-CN. The photoelectrochemical performance of g-CN and the NiO@g-CN nanocomposite photoanodes was compared by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), Chronoamperometry (I-t), and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). All of these results of the characterization studies account for the observed fourfold enhancement of photocurrent density of NiO@g-CN nanocomposite as photoanode in the photoelectrochemical reaction.|| Global problems such as energy crisis and air pollution issues have motivated researchers to conduct research on water-diesel fuel emulsion as a strategic research works. Researchers agree that water emulsion could reduce emissions of NOx and particulate matters (PM) simultaneously. This paper discusses the parameters that affect the properties and stability of the emulsion, as well as the latest technology in the mixing process of water diesel fuel emulsion. Numerous research activities on different parameters that affect the properties and stability of emulsion have been carried out by many researchers, including the effect of mixing time, temperature, mixing speed, surfactant percentage, and water ratio. In addition to these parameter factors, the mixing technology also play crucial position on the characteristics of the emulsion produced. The size of a water droplet was the character of an emulsion that was strongly influenced by the mixing technology. There were various methods in the mixing process of water emulsion fuels such as ultrasonic vibration, a mechanical homogeniser, mechanical agitators, real-time non-surfactant emulsion fuel system (RTES), rotary high-speed blending machines, stirred high speed, high shear mixers or a combination of several of these methods. In the mixing process, many researchers still use a surfactant as an emulsifier. However, in recent years, surfactants are being minimized and the mixing process has been optimised. In the future, research on emulsion fuel still has excellent prospects, including structured design of experiments, economic studies, engine components, supporting policies for emulsion fuel, and advanced mixing technologies.|| Herein, the preparation of a novel nanostructured electrocatalyst (CoB/g-C3N4) and its performance towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is demonstrated. The findings indicate the existence of an effective synergy operating between amorphous CoB and g-C3N4, leading to the high electrochemically active surface area, low electrochemical impedance and charge transfer resistance. As a result, the CoB/g-C3N4 electrode requires substantially lower overpotential (360 mV) with a small Tafel slope (94.4 mV dec(-1)) as compared to bare CoB (103.5 mV dec(-1)) and g-C3N4 (140.2 mV dec(-1)) electrodes to generate the benchmark 10 mA cm(2).

The aim of the present work is to prepare Pt thin films by simple and fast fabrication technique, and to evaluate their performance for HER. The thin films of Pt are grown on two substrates, namely titanium foil (Ti) and nickel foam (NF), using a single step aerosol assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) method. The film deposition time are varied from 20 to 60 min. Microscopic analyses suggest a gradual evolution of the films into percolated and/or porous nanostructures, a feature that remains highly desired to allow the maximum access of active sites. The performance of the asprepared electrodes is evaluated by monitoring the HER in acidic electrolyte. The Pt film on nickel foam (Pt/NF) exhibits better electrical conductivity and smaller charge transfer resistance, while the film deposited on the Ti foil (Pt/Ti) demonstrates superior catalytic activity per active sites. The as-prepared Pt/Ti and Pt/NF electrodes produce 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of 28 mV and 26 mV, respectively, better in performance than commercial Pt/ C electrode (similar to 39 mV), set a new bench mark electrocatalyst for the HER.

The electrodes are prepared in one step by the aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) method within 30 to 120 min. Pd is deposited on titanium (Ti) foil and nickel foam (NF). Microscopic analyses indicate the growth of cauliflower-like porous nanostructures of Pd. Electrochemical measurements indicate that the Pd/NF electrode requires only 65 mV and 189 mV, while the Pd/Ti electrode requires 121 mV and 288 mV to produce current densities of 50 and 150 mA cm(-2), respectively, for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The respective Tafel slopes for Pd/NF and Pt/Ti are determined to be 29.3 mV dec(-1) and 52.3 mV dec(-1), suggesting different rate-determining mechanisms of the HER on various substrate surfaces. The better activity of the Pd/NF electrode is attributed to higher electrical conductivity of bare NF and Pd/NF electrodes compared to that of bare Ti and Pd/Ti electrodes, though the charge transfer resistances are discerned to be comparable. The turnover frequency of the Pd/NF electrode is superior to that of Pd/Ti at lower overpotential, which becomes comparable with increasing potential. The results of this study combined with our earlier findings reveal the bi-functional electrocatalytic nature of the nanoscale Pd for possible utilization in an electrochemical water splitting unit for H-2 and O-2 production.|| In this study, a new magnetic adsorbent, strontium ferrite-bentonite-CoNiAl composite (SF-B-CoNiAl), was synthesized via co-precipitation technique and employed for the adsorptive removal of two anionic dyes, Eriochrome Black T (EBT) and Methyl Orange (MO) from water. The surface functionalities, structure and morphology of the new adsorbent (SF-B-CoNiAl) were evaluated via scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis. The batch experiments indicated that the experimental adsorption capacity of SF-B-CoNiAl was 329.61 and 219.56 mg/g for EBT and MO, respectively. Freundlich isotherm best fitted the experimental data signifying heterogeneous surface with multilayer dyes uptake. The adsorption process of anionic dyes onto SF-B-CoNiAl involves both physisorption and chemisorption. The kinetic data of MO and EBT adsorption by SF-B-CoNiAl were well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The prepared adsorbent exhibited good recyclability that demonstrates their potential for application in water purification.|| Converting water into hydrogen through the photo-electrochemical (PEC) process is one of the most exciting approaches in this field, and there is a quest to design or search for new electro-photo-catalytic materials. In this work, simple steps for fabrication and transformation of metallic tungsten thin film into the photo-active Magneli-phase (W18O49) of tungsten oxide thin film is demonstrated. The post-annealing temperature has a significant impact on the phase evolution of tungsten film into W18O49. The film thickness of W(18)O(49)is controlled by controlling the sputtering time (or deposition time) of W film. The PEC performance of the as-prepared electrodes is evaluated by monitoring the water oxidation reaction under visible radiation. The PEC findings reveal a correlation between PEC performance and phase, morphology, and thickness of the film. The as-derived W(18)O(49)can efficiently catalyze the water oxidation reaction at neutral solution pH, generating 0.6 and 1.4 mA cm(-1)photo-current at 0.6 and 0.8 V vs. Saturated calomel electrode (SCE), respectively, in addition to excellent stability. The electrical conductivity and the charge transfer kinetics are investigated employing the electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) technique.|| Thermoelectric (TE) materials have increasingly entranced the attention of researchers globally, with a view to providing alternative routes to clean energy. This work reports the first thermal conductivity measurement on pulsed laser deposited Bi2Se2.7Te0.3 (BTS) thin films by a non-contact and optical-based method. Structural characterization revealed well-crystalline films whereas the scanning electron microscope images show abundant grains typical of the BTS nanostructures. A highly stoichiometric composition was observed under energy dispersive spectroscopy. The film's first-order temperature coefficient was estimated by varying the substrate temperature using advanced Raman spectrometer equipped with an inbuilt Linkam stage. The linear dependence of the E-2(g) phonon mode on temperature and excitation laser power was harnessed to estimate the value of the suspended film's room temperature thermal conductivity. The first-order temperature coefficient was measured to be 0.0359 cm(-1) K-1. The low thermal conductivity measured at room temperature (kappa similar to 1.12 Wm(-1)K(-1)) is comparable to previously reported values obtained using different conventional techniques. This work proved the potential of Raman spectroscopy to estimate the thermal conductivity as an excellent alternative tool to the existing expensive and laborious techniques. In addition, this work demonstrated that BTS is an excellent material for thermoelectric energy harvesting.|| Using ZnS as a buffer layer in many thin-film solar cells, such as Cu(In, Ga)Se-2 (CIGS), has not been successful as it usually results in a high barrier that suppresses the flow of electrons to the designated contact. To tackle this issue, we analyze dilute oxygen (O) alloys of ZnS as a buffer layer. It exhibits an unusual energy bandgap (E-G) bowing and a sharp increase in electron affinity energy. Such features commonly arise in anion-alloyed compositions due to band anticrossing (BAC) interactions between the introduced defect energy state of O and the extended conduction band edge (CBE) of ZnS that causes a downshift of the CBE. Besides the flexibility of tuning the CBE, this is important to avoid the toxicity of cadmium (Cd) and its compounds. In this article, the band edges of lightly alloyed ZnS1-xOx are computed using an atomistic tight-binding (TB) BAC model. Then, a fitting energy band bowing (EBB) model is developed to capture efficiently the nonlinear variations of their E-G and electron affinity energy. For O composition ranging between 0% and 5%, it is observed that the electron affinity energy sharply increases from 3.3 to 3.98 eV. Also, E-G drastically reduces from 3.8 to 3.08 eV. Device-wise, by analyzing the effect of dilute O alloys and the doping density of the ZnS buffer layer, it is found that electron transport is remarkably improved with O composition. In ZnS0.95O0.05 alloy with doping density 1 x 10(18) cm(-3), the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) reaches approximately 23.82%.|| We have studied the effect of post growth annealing in oxygen ambient on the optical, chemical and electronic properties of zinc nitride thin films. The films were prepared by reactive radio frequency magnetron sputtering of zinc target in the presence of argon and nitrogen gasses at a substrate temperature of 300 degrees C. Post growth annealing was performed at annealing temperatures of 300, 400, 500, 600, and 700 degrees C in the oxygen environment to transform the zinc nitride films into p-type zinc oxide. Atomic force microscopy of the films reveal that surface roughness and grain size of the films are directly proportional to the post-growth annealing temperature. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of the films revealed that as-grown film has the highest intensity of nitrogen in the film whereas little nitrogen remains in the films that were annealed at 500 degrees C and higher temperatures. Films annealed at higher temperatures have lower carrier concentration but higher Hall mobility compared to the as-grown film and the films annealed at lower temperature. Moreover, as-grown film and the films annealed at lower temperature have n-type conductivity whereas films annealed at temperatures above 500 degrees C exhibit p-type conductivity. Films annealed at lower temperature have bandgap values closer to the zinc oxynitride but bandgap of the films annealed at higher temperatures have values close to the bandgap of zinc oxide. This indicates that post growth annealing of zinc nitride films at 500 degrees C in oxygen ambient transforms it into p-type zinc oxide.|| A computational design methodology is reported to propose a high-performance composite for backside encapsulation of concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) systems for enhanced module life and electrical power. Initially, potential polymer composite systems that are expected to provide the target properties, such as thermal conductivity, coefficient of thermal expansion, and long-term shear modulus are proposed using in-house built design codes. These codes are based on differential effective medium theory and mean-field homogenization, which lead to the selection of matrix, filler, volume fractions, and type of particulates. Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) loaded with ceramics fillers of a minimum spherical diameter of 6 mu m are found potential composites. Some representative samples are synthesized through the melt-mixing and compression-molding route and characterized. The target properties including thermal conductivity, coefficient of thermal expansion, viscoelastic parameters, and long-term shear modulus are measured and used to evaluate the performance of CPV modules using previously published finite element model. The proposed composite can drag the cell temperature down by 5.8 degrees C when compared with neat TPU which leads to a 4.3% increase in electrical power along with a reasonable module life. It is expected that this approach will make a baseline for the effective production of polymer composites in various industrial applications.|| The continuous demand for olefins has stimulated recent research to develop appropriate technology to produce olefins from alternative resources. Syngas-to-olefins (STO) is considered to be a promising pathway due to the availability of numerous technologies to produce syngas from municipal solid waste and biomass. The development of catalysts to obtain high CO conversion and high selectivity to olefins is still in progress. The first route is based on iron and cobalt catalysts via Fischer Tropsch synthesis to olefins (FTO) with a range of promising supports and promoters. The second approach is based on metal oxide-zeolite (OX-ZEO) composites, with a focus on combined metal oxides to increase the CO conversion. Finally, the potency of less-explored zeolite frameworks such as FER, KFI and Rho zeolites is highlighted. We propose that researchers should focus on FER, KFI and Rho zeolites. However, further reaction mechanism studies should be elaborated to obtain their optimum conditions for STO.|| A new highly selective chemosensor, based on fluorescein-allyloxy benzene conjugate 1, was developed for the sequential detection of palladium and chromium oxyanions in a mixed aqueous media, and was studied by UV-visible and fluorescence spectroscopy. The sensing of palladium ions produces a chemodosimetric and ratiometric change in the emission band of 1 from 450 to 525 nm, followed by the sensing of chromate ions by 2 that quenches the emission band at 525 nm in a buffered H2O: DMF solution (9:1, pH = 7.4). The rate constants of palladium and chromate ions were found to be 8.6 x 10(5) M-1 , 2.1 x 10(5) M-1, and 5.4 x 10(4) M-1 respectively. The chemosensor 1 has a palladium detection limit of 49 ppb while the sequential detection limit of chromate ions (CrO42- and Cr2O72-) were 127 and 259 ppb. The ratiometric change in the emission is produced due to the deallylation of 1 by palladium to produce 2 that restores the ESIPT (excited state intramolecular proton transfer) of the phenolic ring and enhances the electron transfer (ET) phenomenon from the phenolic group to fluorescein. The sequential binding of chromate ions to 2 inhibits the ESIPT and causes chelation enhanced quenching (CHEQ) of the fluorescence.|| Cadmium sulfide-graphitic carbon nitride nanocomposite was synthesized by pulsed laser ablation in liquid, and it was found from the results of optical and morphological characterizations that the proper anchoring of nanostructured cadmium sulfide on the nano-sheets of graphitic carbon nitride took place, which brought about the positive attributes such as enhanced visible light absorption and reduced photo-generated charge recombination, the key features required for an efficient photo-catalyst by solar light harvesting. The pulsed laser ablation in liquid method adopted for the synthesis of cadmium sulfide-graphitic carbon nitride has the following advantages: the shape and size of the synthesized particles can be controlled by altering the experimental parameters such as laser wavelength, pulse laser duration, the pH of the solution, the surfactants and the temperature of the solution, pulsed laser ablation in liquid method neither requires cumbersome equipment nor does it require intermediate chemicals and catalysts nor does it necessitate the post synthesis purification. The enhancement of photo-catalytic activity of cadmium sulfide-graphitic carbon nitride nanocomposite was tested for the photo-catalytic deactivation of Escherichia colt bacteria in water under visible light radiation. As anticipated, a significant improvement of photo-catalytic deactivation was observed, which is attributed to the enhanced and extended light absorption in the visible spectral region, and the formation of herterojunction between the semiconductors, which is instrumental in inhibiting the undesired recombination of photo-generated charge carriers. Quantitatively, the presence of cadmium sulfide on the graphitic carbon nitride surface contributed to a remarkable 129% increase of photo-catalytic degradation constant compared to pure graphitic carbon nitride, which resulted in the decrease of total depletion time of Escherichia colt from 156 min to 67 min with the cadmium sulfide-graphitic carbon nitride nanocomposite synthesized by pulsed laser ablation in liquid method. Our results on the efficient photo-catalytic deactivation of Escherichia colt under visible light assures that cadmium sulfide-graphitic carbon nitride nanocomposite can very well be used for photo-catalytic water purification by harvesting the abundant solar light.|| It is obtained that nano-Co3O4-coated carbon prepared by thermal decomposition of Co(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O at 300 degrees C on home-made Albizia procera (Roxb.) leaves derived carbon is an efficient electrocatalyst for electrochemical water oxidation in 0.1 M NaOH (aq.) solution. The loading of nano-Co3O4 on the carbon was changed by varying the amount of precursor of cobalt (100-1000 mg) and using a constant amount of the carbon (200 mg) during thermal decomposition. The prepared samples were characterized by physical techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XRD, TEM, FESEM, and EDS confirmed the formation of uniformly distributed nanoparticles of single-phase Co3O4 on the surface of carbon. The XRD data reveals formation of nano-Co3O4 with average particle sizes in the range of 9-17 nm. The FESEM micrographs demonstrate that Co3O4 nanoparticles, having irregular morphology, are uniformly and densely covered on the surface of supporting carbon.. The prepared samples were immobilized on the filter paper derived carbon electrode (FPCE) to study their electrocatalytic properties toward water oxidation. The cyclic voltammetric studies showed that the nano-Co3O4-C prepared using 400 mg of Co(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O (nano-Co3O4-C-400), which possesses meso- and macropores with BET surface area of 192.4 m(2)/g, reaches a current density of 28 mAcm(-2) at 1.5 V and electrochemical water oxidation starting potential of 0.7 V. In this work, it is also shown that the current densities, at 1.5 V, increase by increasing the amount of cobalt oxide in the prepared samples though. The nano-Co3O4-C-400 catalyst shows optimum performance for electrochemical water oxidation in terms of starting water oxidation potential, reasonable amount of Co3O4 and moderate level of current density at 1.5 V.

Tar, the by product, must be reduced to a minimum. In this study, tar was suppressed by applying multi-stage downdraft gasifier with three air inlets in the zone of pyrolysis, oxidation, and reduction in which the whole air for the entire zone was regulated at 21.12 kg/h according to the equivalent ratio (ER) of 0.4. Fixed equivalent ratio was used as a benchmark for single stage numerous air ratios for the three zones were investigated used to obtain optimum performance. The optimum ratio was found to be 10:80:10. LHV and CGE were increased as the increase in CO, H-2 and CH4 concentrations which were triggered by the increase in temperature and the increased rate of the reaction that produces the gas. Char and air oxidation reactions not only occurred in the partial oxidation zone but also occurred in the pyrolysis and reduction zones or the oxidative pyrolysis and heterogeneous oxidation reactions so that the layers of hot zones increased. Tar passed the larger hot zones was favorable for the thermal cracking of tar. Pyrolysis temperature rose of from 449 degrees C to 521 degrees C and energy neutral point has been reached so that changes like endothermic be exothermic. The air in the reduction zone activated the char layer to be more reactive. Improved performance multi-stage air inlet as compared with single stage gasifier can be used as a reference in the optimization of operating parameters for the wider applications of further MSW gasification.|| Commercial BEA zeolite was modified under the radiation of microwave labstation with different modification strategies. Catalytic properties and textural properties were manipulated by desilication using sodium hydroxide or tetrapropyl ammonium hydroxide solution. It was found that sodium hydroxide can lead to very fragile textural properties and low catalytic activity. While tetrapropyl ammonium hydroxide is highly recommended for the improvement of textural properties, especially at long desilication time. Parent and desilicated samples were further modified by octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) in order to add the silane functionality to the zeolitic materials. This addition led to minimizing the textural properties of the silane-treated BEA zeolites and consequentially led to a reduction in the catalytic activity. Recovering and improving the catalytic activity and textural properties were then performed by calcining the silane-treated catalyst to combust the long-chain alkyl groups, which facilitate the formation of silica layer. Another modification strategy was found that the desilicated BEA sample can enhance the catalytic activity and catalytic stability when it treated with a low concentration of nitric acid after desilication. This modification strategy led to improving the catalytic conversion from 29% to 76%.|| Polymeric-inorganic graphitic carbon nitride-cadmium sulfide (g-C3N4-CdS) nanocomposites, with different mass ratios of CdS (5 %,10 %, 20 % and 30 %) anchored in g-C3N4 network were synthesized for the first time by laser ablation technique, using a nanosecond pulsed laser of 532 nm wavelength in water medium. The synthesized g-C3N4-CdS nanocomposites were used as a catalyst in the process of photo-catalytic degrading toxic cationic and anionic dyes in aqueous solutions under visible light irradiation. Our results revealed that g-C3N4-CdS nanocomposites, in general showed better photo-catalytic efficiency than that shown by pure g-C3N4, particularly, the nanocomposite with 20 % CdS in g-C3N4-CdS yielded the highest efficiency in the photo-catalytic degradation of both the dyes under study. The enhanced photo-catalytic degradation efficiency of g-C3N4-CdS nanocomposites, in general is mainly due to the enhanced visible light absorption brought about by the anchoring of CdS on the g-C3N4 network, and also due to the reduced photo-generated charge recombination mediated by the formation of heterojunction between the two semiconducting composite partners, which are quite evident respectively from the recorded UV-DRS and PL spectra of g-C3N4-CdS nanocomposites. Besides optical characterizations, structural, elemental and morphological characterizations, using XRD, FE-SEM, TEM, HR-TEM, XPS and FT-IR were carried out and the results of this work is elucidated in the light of the characterization studies.|| The fillers/nanofillers combinations with ideal interfacial morphologies could adjust the performance of pristine polymeric membranes and enhance the gas separation performances. In this study, biomass-derived 2D carboxyl functionalized nanocarbon (nanosheets) were produced from pyrolysis of the rain/monkey pod tree (Samanea saman) leaves. The X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the chemical structure and carboxyl functionalization of carbon nanosheets (CCNS). The carboxyl-functionalized nanosheets blended into polyetherimide (PEI) solutions was used to fabricate mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) through modified dry/wet phase inversion method using different wt. % [0.0%, 0.25%, 0.5% and 1.0% of CCNS] of fillers into the pristine PEI NMP solutions. Surface and cross-sectional micrographs discerned the defects and dispersion of CCNS into the polymer matrix. Finally, the transport properties of pure gases (CH4 and CO2) were evaluated using constant pressure/variable volume apparatus. The gas separation studies showed improved permeance and selectivity of MMMs [(P-CO2 = 1.84 GPU, (alpha = CO2/CH4) = 42.73] than pristine PEI membranes [P-CO2 = 1.29 GPU, (alpha = CO2/CH4) = 23.30] under identical conditions of pressure and temperature.|| The present work demonstrates the synthesis, characterization and biological activities of different concentrations of tin doped indium oxide nanoparticles (Sn doped In2O3 NPs), i.e., (Sn/In = 5%, 10% and 15%). We have synthesized different size (38.11 nm, 18.46 nm and 10.21 nm) of Sn doped In2O3 NPs. by using an ultra-sonication process. The Sn doped In2O3 NPs were characterized by by x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) which confirmed the successful doping of tin (Sn) with Indium oxide (In2O3). Anticandidal activity was performed by standard agar dilution method using Candida albicans for the study. The minimum inhibitory/fungicidal concentration (MIC/MFC) values recorded were, 8 & >8 mg/ml for pure In2O3 NPs, 4 & 8 mg/ml for 5%, 2 & 8 mg/ml for 10%, whereas 1 & >4 mg/ml for 15% Sn doped In2O3 NPs, respectively. The topographical alteration caused by Sn doped In2O3 NPs on Candida cells, was clearly observed by SEM examination. A significant enhancement in anticandidal activity was seen, when Candida cells were exposed to (Sn/In = 5%, 10% and 15%). Moreover, we have also evaluated the impact of Sn-In2O3 NPs on human colorectal carcinoma cells (HCT-116). The results demonstrated that Sn-In2O3 NPs (Sn/In = 5%, 10% and 15%), caused dose dependent decrease in the cancer cell viability as the low dosage (2.0 mg/mL) showed 62.11% cell viability, while 4.0, 8.0, 16.0, 32.0 mg/mL dosages showed 20.45%, 18.25%, 16.58%, and 15.58% cell viability. In addition, the treatment of Sn-In2O3 NPs also showed significant cellular and anatomical changes in cancer cells as examined by microscopes. We have also examined the impact of Sn-In2O3 NPs (5%, 10%, 15%) on normal cells (HEK-293) and the results demonstrate that Sn-In2O3 NPs did not reduce the cell viability of normal cells.|| The thermomechanical behavior of micro/nano-alumina (Al2O3) ceramics reinforced with 1-5 wt.% of acid-treated oil fly ash (OFA) was investigated.

The traditional omnidirectional pattern of a slot antenna is made directional by using a single slot-based complementary wideband reflector (CWBR) element. The proposed CWBR is compact in size, simple in construction, and is based on a single-layer geometry unlike complex multi-layer reflectors used in the literature. It improves the front-to-back ratio between 5 and 17 dB in the entire frequency range covering 2.5-4.5 GHz. The proposed reconfigurable MIMO antenna system covers the LTE and WiMAX bands with a minimum measured bandwidth of 200 MHz per covered bands. The frequency reconfigurability is achieved by reactively loading the slot loop with varactor diodes. The overall size of the proposed antenna system is 40 x 100 x 0.76mm(3), making it suitable for tablet handheld devices and access points. It has a maximum measured peak gain of 5 dBi and total measured radiation efficiency of 78%. The proposed MIMO antenna system has port isolation of >10 dB within the entire band of operation. The radiation patterns are isolated in space from each other and ensure very low envelope correlation coefficient.|| Electro-absorption and electro-optic characteristics of InAs& x002F;InP quantum-dash active region-based waveguide, emitting at & x223C;1600 nm is investigated. Two major peaks were observed in the change of absorption spectrum with a maximum value of 7070 cm(& x2212;1) at a bias voltage of -8V with an excellent uniform extinction ratio of & x223C;15 dB across the wavelength range of operation (1460& x2013;1620 nm). The effect of temperature on electro-absorption (EA) measurement suggests a strong influence resulting in merging of two major change of absorption spectrum peaks with higher temperature. Furthermore, electro-optic measurements indicate a change in refractive index and its efficiency values of & x223C;2.9 & x00D7; 10(& x2212;4) and & x223C;0.5 & x00D7; 10(& x2212;4)& x00A0;V-& x2212;1, respectively, hence exhibiting a low chirping factor of 0.9 and 1.5 at bias voltages of & x2212;2& x00A0;V and & x2212;4& x00A0;V, respectively. As a quasi-three-dimensionally confined structure possessing both quantum well- and quantum dot-like features, the quantum dash waveguide showed superior electro-absorption and electro-optic properties compared to quantum dots and close to that of quantum wells, while attaining low chirp and broad wavelength range of operation. This paves a way for potential realization of quantum dash-based EA and electro-optic modulator for future optical access networks, particularly operating in wide C- to L-band region.|| Due to their large aperture size, coprime arrays are good candidate in the presence of mutual coupling as most of the elements are separated by more than half-wavelength. However, the number of consecutive lags in their difference coarray is limited. Combining three uniform linear subarrays where the number of elements in the subarrays are pairwise coprime integers overcomes this limitation. The resultant array is referred to as three-level prime array (3LPA). The 3LPA has a closed form expression for antenna locations and can improve the DOF using smaller aperture size compared with coprime arrays. In this paper, we derive an approximate expression for the achievable DOF for the 3LPA configuration. Simulation results confirm the validity of the derived expressions compared with the exact DOF.

The MIMO system consists of 4 identical active antenna elements reactively loaded with varactor diodes to achieve frequency reconfigurability over a band from 1.5 to 2.1 GHz. The distinguishing feature of the proposed work is achieving Yagi-like directional characteristics over a very wide frequency band. The conventional omni-directional pattern of a slot antenna is made directional by using a parasitic metallic reflector layer below the substrate. By using the reflector element, the back-lobe radiation is highly suppressed and a front-to-back ratio of 5-13 dB is achieved within the entire frequency band of operation. The proposed design is compact with an overall size of $100 \times 100\times 20\,{\rm mm}<^>3$100x100x20mm3, and a reflector size of $110 \times 110\,{\rm mm}<^>2$110x110mm2. A single element has a maximum peak gain of 4 dBi and total measured radiation efficiency of 76%. The antenna system also shows good MIMO performance with high port isolation of 11.3 dB and very low envelope correlation coefficient values within the operational band.|| Modular multilevel converter (MMC) based HVDC system for renewable energy integration has attracted the researcher's interest nowadays. This paper proposes a control strategy for MMC based multiterminal HVDC system for grid integration of squirrel cage induction generator (SCIG) based wind energy systems. Unlike the average model, this work models the MMC using the aggregate model and develops multiterminal HVDC transmission network in MATLAB/Simulink. It further develops the MMC multiterminal HVDC transmission network in real time digital simulator (RTDS). Instead of simplified current source, the proposed network considers the complete dynamics of SCIG based wind source from generation to integration. It employs field-oriented control for optimum wind energy tracking and forms isolated AC grids using feed forward controller. The proposed MMC controller performance has been tested under severe balanced and unbalanced disturbances. The results from aggregate model based MMC network in MATLAB/Simulink and those of the experimental MMC network in RTDS are in full agreement. The results confirm optimum wind energy tracking, fulfill grid code requirements, and improve low voltage ride through capability.|| we report a tunable self-injection locked violet laser diode external cavity system exhibiting a continuous wavelength tunability of 5.15 nm (400.28 - 405.43 nm) with mean side-mode-suppression-ratio (SMSR) and linewidth of similar to 23 dB and similar to 190 pm, respectively. The effects of injection current and temperature indicate a robust system besides being cost-effective and straightforward. Moreover, a successful indoor on-off keying transmission at two different locked modes on a 0.4 m free space channel showed similar to 10 times improvement in the bit-error-rate (BER) with value similar to 8 x10(-4) at 2 Gb/s, and better performance on 0.8 m channel length at 1.75 Gb/s compared to the free-running laser case. Our work is a potential step towards the realization of future high data capacity narrow-wavelength-spaced multiplexed optical wireless communication system wherein continuously tunable laser sources are expected to play a crucial role as transmitters.|| Voltage source converter (VSC)-based multiterminal high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems received widespread attention throughout the world for grid integration of renewable energy resources in recent years. This paper presents a comparative performance analysis of different VSC-based outer control and inner current controllers for the multiterminal HVDC system. It employs either lead-lag (LL) or proportional-integral (PI) controllers for outer DC link voltage control, whereas it uses PI or model predictive controllers (MPCs) for inner current control. Hence, it designs four combinations of controllers (LL-MPC, LL-PI, PI-MPC, and PI-PI) to control the outer DC link voltage and inner current of the VSC-based multiterminal HVDC system. Besides, it proposes an integral time squared-error (ITSE)-based optimization technique to tune the parameters of the employed PI controllers that selects optimal parameters at minimum ITSE under extreme operating condition. The combination of the mentioned controllers forms the main control unit of the multiterminal HVDC transmission network for regulation of the DC link voltage and the power flow. Moreover, this article evaluates the controller performance in terms of maximum overshoot, steady-state error, settling time, rise time, and total harmonic distortion. It implements the proposed controllers in a typical VSC-HVDC system and multiterminal HVDC transmission system in MATLAB/SIMULINK platform. Presented results confirm the efficacy of the four-type controllers. The optimized PI-MPC controller provides overall better performance relative to other controllers.|| This study proposes a new averaged model for steady-state and dynamic response analysis of the electric spring (ES). The accuracy of steady-state and dynamic behaviour of the ES is demonstrated. Further, the dynamic behaviour of the proposed model is described as a function of the modulating signal. The developed model is used to design a controller for bus voltage regulation in a distribution system with an intermittent renewable energy source. The ES controller design problem is formulated as an optimization problem with a time domain-based objective function to reduce the time-weighted voltage deviations using particle swarm optimization method. Different disturbances have been applied to verify the developed ES model accuracy including sudden changes in renewable source current and load variations. An experimental analysis is also performed with the detailed non-linear switching model of the ES to verify its behaviour with that of the proposed averaged model. The characteristics and performance of ES are thoroughly investigated. The effectiveness of the developed model and the proposed controller design approach is demonstrated in terms of a significant improvement in the dynamic performance of the distribution system|| A prism-based self-injection locked seamlessly tunable blue InGaN/GaN laser diode composite cavity system is presented. A rigorous analysis of this external cavity diode laser (ECDL) system is performed at two different optical feedback powers. At 130 mA low injection, the high reflection system (HRS) exhibits a record wideband tuning span of similar to 12.11 nm with a side-mode-suppression-ratio (SMSR) >= 15 dB, measuring as high as 40 dB, linewidth <= 110 pm, and a working power of about 3 mW. Whereas, a tuning range of 8 nm with linewidth <= 88 pm, SMSR >= 13 dB, reaching a maximum of 35 dB with 14.5 mW usable power is achieved from the low reflection system (LRS) at the same injection current. Moreover, an inverse relationship between the optical power and the tunability is observed in both the systems with a value as high as 180 mW exhibited by LRS configuration and attaining a tunability of 4.5 nm. Both systems highlight high stability even at higher injection currents and temperature. Such a robust, simple, and compact system may serve as a crucial light source in a plethora of diverse applications besides visible optical communications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on a continuously tunable self-injection locked tunable laser system.|| Conventional breast cancer detection techniques including X-ray mammography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound scanning suffer from shortcomings such as excessive cost, harmful radiation, and inconveniences to the patients. These challenges motivated researchers to investigate alternative methods including the use of microwaves. This article focuses on reviewing the background of microwave techniques for breast tumour detection. In particular, this study reviews the recent advancements in active microwave imaging, namely microwave tomography and radar-based techniques. The main objective of this paper is to provide researchers and physicians with an overview of the principles, techniques, and fundamental challenges associated with microwave imaging for breast cancer detection. Furthermore, this study aims to shed light on the fact that until today, there are very few commercially available and cost-effective microwave-based systems for breast cancer imaging or detection. This conclusion is not intended to imply the inefficacy of microwaves for breast cancer detection, but rather to encourage a healthy debate on why a commercially available system has yet to be made available despite almost 30 years of intensive research.|| In electronic warfare systems, the optimization of the adaptive antenna array's parameters toward achieving a certain null or maximum at specific directions could consume a long time. This may be crucial especially when a quick reaction is required before the spatial situation changes. In this work, a novel technique based on the Schelkunoff theory of incorporating nulls into the array factor (AF) expression is presented. It is shown that by introducing these nulls in the AF, the number of unknown array coefficients to be optimized is reduced. Hence, the optimization processing time is considerably decreased compared to the conventional all parameters technique, without impairing other radiation pattern characteristics such as the beamwidth or the side lobe level.|| A simple solution is presented for identifying the phase fraction and flow rate of a petroleum carrying pipeline with three-phase stratified smooth and wavy flow. The proposed method mounts a set of semicylindrical electrodes on the internal surface of the Plexiglas pipe to monitor the total capacitance and resistance of the three-phase contents. The phase fractions are determined by relating these electrical properties with the phase angles associated with the interface between water, oil, and gas phases of the mixture. To calculate the flow rate, measured capacitances from two sets of electrodes with known separation distance are cross-correlated to determine time delay. Calculated and measured results demonstrated close agreement. The percentage error exhibited by the proposed inclined capacitive plate technique is calculated and compared with published values.|| Technical advances and reduced technology costs have led to a significant increase in the use of renewable energy-based distributed generators (DGs) in the existing distribution grids. Modern distribution grid operation is also related to the efforts and incentives to influence changes in customers' behavior and load use, known as demand side management (DSM). The effective implementation of renewable energy source (RES)-based DGs and DSM, particularly in microgrid operating modes, may benefit customers and distribution networks. This changes in the reliability performance of distribution networks owing to the integration of wind and photovoltaic DGs are evaluated in this study along with the implementation of load shifting and peak clipping DSM schemes for residential, commercial, and industrial load sectors. A reliability evaluation is based on energy not supplied and unavailability (hours per year), calculated by considering the seasonal changes in wind speed and solar irradiation, which are represented by their corresponding Weibull distribution functions. Load variations are incorporated using a normal distribution function. The reliability performances of different RES-based DGs and DSM schemes are evaluated using the non-sequential Monte Carlo simulation approach for modeling the random occurrence of faults in the system resulting in customer interruptions with the corresponding repair times required to restore the supply.|| A new variable step-size strategy for the least mean square (LMS) algorithm is presented for distributed estimation in adaptive networks using the diffusion scheme. This approach utilizes the ratio of filtered and windowed versions of the squared instantaneous error for iteratively updating the step-size. The result is that the dependence of the update on the power of the error is reduced. The performance of the algorithm improves even though it is at the cost of added computational complexity. However, the increase in computational complexity can be minimized by careful manipulation of the update equation, resulting in an excellent performance-complexity trade-off. Complete theoretical analysis is presented for the proposed algorithm including stability, transient and steady-state analyses. Extensive experimental analysis is then done to show the performance of the proposed algorithm under various scenarios.|| While the concept of microgrids and renewable energy systems is not entirely new, these integrated technologies have become a special topic of interest for researchers, utility providers and governments. Many challenges must be overcome to achieve better integration of renewable sources into the energy framework. This study presents some viable possibilities for the utilisation of a hybridised microgrid system. The hybridisation is achieved by an efficient design approach for the enhancement of both load and system reliability indices through the intelligent placement and sizing of hybrid distributed generation (DG) systems. Real-time models of solar photovoltaics, wind turbines, batteries and thermal DGs are presented and implemented. Also, network component failures are stochastically modelled via Monte Carlo simulations, and a general tie-set algorithm using an adapted breadth-first search is proposed. Moreover, mixed-integer multi-objective particle swarm optimisation is employed, giving a four-dimensional Pareto solution that is attained by optimising four reliability-related objectives, namely system average interruption frequency index, System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI), Energy Not Supplied (ENS) and total cost.|| In this work, a novel miniaturized meandered slot-line-based quad-band multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antenna system is presented. The proposed design consists of two-antenna elements meandered in an H-shaped configurations. The miniaturization techniques of meandered slot-line and reactive loading are implemented to operate the antenna in sub-1 GHz bands with compact structure which results in an antenna size of 0.08 lambda(0) corresponding to its lowest operating band. The frequency reconfigurability in the design is achieved by reactively loading the slots using varactor diodes. Covering most of the modern communication standards, the antenna operates in 0.665-1.13 GHz, 1.415-2.005 GHz, 2.42-3.09 GHz, and 3.18-3.89 GHz bands. Furthermore, complete analysis of frequency reconfigurability and design procedure is provided as a guideline for designing such an antenna system for any desired band of operation. The proposed two-element design is realized on a board dimensions of 60 x 120 x 0.76 mm(3) using an RO4350 substrate. The proposed design is well-suited for wireless terminals with second generation cognitive radio (CR) capabilities for radio-frequency (RF) front-end applications.|| This paper presents an all-digital technique to control DC-DC switching buck converters for noise-sensitive low-power applications. The controller is designed based on a multi-sampling frequency digital delta-sigma modulator, whose sampling frequency is adjusted according to the load current. The proposed controller demonstrates the efficiency performance of the digital pulse-width modulation controller counterpart at heavy load while reducing output spikes by 37 dB without any additional processing. At light load, the controller scales down the switching frequency by scaling down delta-sigma modulator sampling frequency. Consequently, light-load efficiency is improved by more than 40% compared to its fixed frequency counterpart. In particular, the proposed solution adopts a unity-gain signal-transfer function delta-sigma modulator that avoids excess phase in the control loop. The proposed technique is compact, scalable and compatible with the standard digital CMOS implementation. Experimental and simulation results characterizing the proposed solution are provided.|| This paper presents a new methodology to optimize the configuration of the hybrid energy system with the wind farm, photovoltaic array, diesel generator and battery bank. Minimizing the annual cost is considered as an objective function with different constraints considering energy not served and renewable energy fraction. The lightning search algorithm is employed to obtain the best cost value of hybrid power system construction. Annual load data, solar irradiation and output power of wind turbines are used in the optimization analysis with a 10-min resolution. The behavior of different components of the system has been investigated. Simulation results give the optimal decision variables: number PV panels, wind turbines, battery banks and the capacity of the diesel generator with the electrification costs (capital cost, and fuel cost) over 1 year for ten scenarios of the hybrid energy system. The results confirm the potential of the proposed approach for the cheapest renewable energy generation.|| This paper proposes a new approach for the capacitor balancing of a dual three-level T-type converter based on silicon carbide discrete semiconductors. This study is performed while the converter feeds an open-end induction motor. The model predictive control (MPC) scheme is developed to balance the dc-link capacitors and to control the machine torque simultaneously. The proposed technique for MPC reduces the number of redundant switching states that are used in computations without affecting the operating voltage vectors. This reduces the computational time substantially. In addition, the proposed control strategy mitigates the weighting factor tuning problem of capacitor balancing in addition to the conventional MPC cost function. MATLAB simulation results for the proposed drive system under different case studies are presented. Hardware experimental setup for the proposed converter is built, tested, and verified. A comparison between experimental and simulation results is presented. It is observed that the theoretical as well as the experimental results are in full agreement.|| In this work, we report the performance evaluation of Erbium/Ytterbium (Er3+/Yb3+) codoped fiber amplifier based on theoretical simulations. The proposed design achieved a broadband small signal gain of around 43.5 dB while incorporating a short length of 10 m codoped fiber at an optimized pump power of 100 mW. A minimum noise figure of 4.9 dB was observed at 1560 nm.|| Original work on direction of arrival (DOA) estimation relied on uniform linear arrays (ULAs) of antennas. Most of the work focused on improving the algorithms and the configuration of the antenna array and overlooked the effects of practical antennas on the algorithm performance. Very limited work studied DOA estimation within the physical limitations of handheld devices. In this work, we introduce three nonuniform linear coprime arrays based on patch and monopole antenna elements operating in 2.1 and 5.8 GHz bands and assess their behaviour in DOA estimation. The complex radiation patterns of the arrays were incorporated in the DOA estimation algorithm using compressed sensing (CS). Estimation accuracy is quantified by the root mean square error (RMSE) and the results are compared with those obtained by using isotropic antennas, showing that physical antennas can introduce up to 8 degrees of error. Simulations were also carried out using the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm to demonstrate the advantage of CS in coprime arrays. The MUSIC algorithm failed to detect all sources even at maximum SNR. The impact of reducing the fundamental inter-element spacing in coprime arrays below $0.5\lambda $0.5 lambda to achieve smaller array sizes is investigated as well.|| This paper proposes a novel application of the homotopy method to design accurate non-causal complex-valued seismic FIR wavefield extrapolation digital filters for the purpose of seismic migration. The FIR filter design problem is solved using the scalar homotopy continuation method, since the filter design system of equations is over-determined. In addition, the design approach was modified to satisfy the consistency conditions of the scalar homotopy method. Being a novel application to design FIR filters, the scalar homotopy method requires longer running design time compared to other existing methods such as the Weighted Least Squares (WLSQ) and the L-1-norm methods. At the same time, the homotopy method is globally convergent and does not require the inversion of the Jacobian matrix, which is a significant advantage for practical purposes. Finally, the designed wavefield extrapolation digital filters were tested using the challenging Marmousi model data set, where prestack migration was performed successfully.

However, this class of structures introduces inherent limitations such as thermionic emission (and the related dark current). This article theoretically proposes using the metal-semiconductor-metal heterojunction under bifacial mode. In this design, plasmonic periodic gratings are introduced in the bifacial configuration to allow collection of light from both faces of the solar junction. This results in improved carrier generation and enhanced device performance of a cell with a 3 mu m thick Si absorber. Bifacial gain for short circuit current is found to be 88%, with a bifaciality factor (the ratio of rear to front response of the device) of 84%. By optimizing the filling fractions of the front and rear plasmonic gratings, the obtained normalized output becomes higher than 25%; i.e., it almost doubles the performance in comparison with the monofacial Schottky solar cell.|| The non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes, where the users are allowed to share the same time-frequency resource, have recently received a major interest to meet the increasing demands for higher data rates, improved user fairness, and/or lower latency applications in future dense-user wireless networks. Moreover, the achievable user rates of NOMA schemes can be further increased through the integration of these multiple access schemes with other enabling schemes such as full-duplex user cooperative communications. In this paper, the optimization of the achievable max-min rates for full-duplex cooperative NOMA (CNOMA) schemes for the two-user scenario are re-visited and is extended to the three-user scenario where novel expressions for the optimal user cooperation power are derived for both scenarios. The obtained results shed new lights on the optimal transmit power allocation and the optimal user cooperation power allocation in CNOMA systems and the different design trade-offs in such systems.|| Energy is present in every touch we make in our modern life. However, with the increase of energy-consuming devices, there is a burden to meet this demand with a clean power generation. Although solar and wind are considered as clean and renewable energy resources, many issues engender with their higher penetration into electricity grids. However, when renewable energy resources are integrated with battery energy storage systems (BESS), more smoothed and easily dispatchable power can be obtained. This paper investigates the smoothing quality of the solar photovoltaic power output with the help of BESS using a couple of approaches such as low pass filtering (LPF), moving average (MA) filtering, Gaussian filter (GF) and Saviztky-Golay (S-G) filter. Obviously, the smoothed dispatchable power has been achieved with all mentioned methods, however, the performance of moving average and low pass filters is not acceptable comparatively especially when longer window size and time constant are used, which consequently deteriorates the performance of storage system. In contrast, the paper introduces using the Savitsky-Golay filter to reduce battery ramp rate and battery charging and discharging power while smoothing the solar power fluctuations. The simulation results depict the performance of the proposed smoothing filter and compare its performance against MA, LPF and GF.|| Microgrids (MGs) offer a new paradigm for the operation of electricity networks, allowing end users to significantly improve the power quality and, more importantly, reliability of their power supply systems. While it is clear that MGs offer a significant advantage by providing electricity to customers who would otherwise be disconnected during outages, there are numerous issues with the safe, secure, and efficient operation of MGs, the most basic being integrated management and coordinated control of all resources in grid-connected and off-grid modes. A valuable component that can provide new opportunities for increased reliability of the system and reduced vulnerability to faults is the electric vehicle (EV). One of the major benefits of utilizing EV energy storage is the mobility feature of EVs, which can add great value to the restoration of the power distribution system. The main aim of this work is to understand and model how EV batteries can be used as an intelligent energy reservoir, utilizing both controllable loads (home-to-vehicle and grid-to-vehicle) and controllable energy storage (vehicle-to-home and vehicle-to-grid). This requires modeling the stochastic behavior of EV driving and charging/discharging as well as quantifying the impact of utilizing EV energy storage to restore service to customers. This paper proposes an EV Markov adequacy model that evaluates the reliability of an MG distribution system utilizing EVs and investigates EV mobility and available capacity modeling and EV system adequacy analysis, including the effects on the system reliability of the EV capacity, driving behavior, recharging mode, and EV penetration.|| Traditional seismic data acquisition systems used for surveying during the exploration of oil and gas rely on cables between geophones and the data collection center. Despite the fact that cable-based systems provide reliable seismic data transfer, their deployment and maintenance costs increase substantially as the survey area increases in scale. Therefore, a three layer wireless network architecture is proposed in this work, which consists of wireless geophones (WG) and a data center with an intermediate wireless gateway node (WGN). This paper investigates the aggregate data throughput, transmission time, and energy consumption from WGs to the WGN in a wireless geophone network architecture based on the IEEE 802.11af standard. This standard is considered in order to have the maximum possible range and low power consumption due to operating in TV bands. Analytical expressions of the aforementioned quantities are derived using Markov chain models. Two Markov models are considered for this purpose: one for modeling the access method that allows multiple WGs to connect to a WGN and the other for representing a buffer in a WG. Since seismic data is recorded at regular intervals, arrivals of data packets in the buffer of the WG is deterministic. On the other hand, departure is random due to the multiple access method. Hence, in this work D/M/1/B queue is used for the first time to model the buffer in a wireless geophone. Furthermore, the physical layer constraints are also taken into account together with proper wireless path-loss channel models. The results obtained are useful for designing such wireless seismic networks without extensive simulations. In particular, the proposed joint medium access control, physical layer, and D/M/1/B model enables us to optimize the required number of WGNs. Finally, sectoring is also introduced in order to minimize the total number of WGNs needed to cover the whole surveying area.|| State space systems and experimental system identification are essential components of control education. Early introduction of these tools to the curriculum of a control laboratory in an interconnected and accessible manner that does not over-dilute the concepts is important in two ways. First, it facilitates a student's transition to more senior and graduate level control concepts. It also provides an effective link to industrial applications. This paper provides two novel experimental procedures for directly identifying the state space model of a DC motor in an undergraduate control laboratory. The procedures do not require any specialized hardware and can be performed using standard laboratory equipment. They also do not place any simplifying assumptions on the motor's mo","|| Frequency reconfigurable Yagi-like MIMO antenna system with a wideband reflector|| Electro-absorption and Electro-optic

Fixed Point Theory Appl. 22:8, 2020] and Bisht[ J. Fixed Point Theory Appl. 21:54, 2019] for a pair of asymptotically regular mappings. Our work improves some other comparable results existing in the literature.|| The Farkas-Minkowski constraint qualification is an important concept within the theory and applications of mathematical programs with inequality constraints. In this paper, we mainly deal with the robust version of Farkas-Minkowski constraint qualification for convex inequality system under data uncertainty. We prove that the existence of robust global error bound is a sufficient condition for ensuring robust Farkas-Minkowski constraint qualification for convex inequality system in face of data uncertainty, where the uncertain data belong to a prescribed compact and convex uncertainty set. Moreover, we show that the converse is true for convex quadratic inequality system, when the uncertain data belong to a scenario uncertainty set.|| A class of invex nonlinear complementarity (NCP) functions is introduced. The existence of such a function is illustrated by citing nontrivial examples. Some interesting properties of invex NCP functions have been developed. Quasi-invex NCP functions and their properties are also presented.|| Control charts are commonly used tools that deal with monitoring of process parameters in an efficient manner. Multivariate control charts are more practical and are of greater importance for timely detection of assignable causes in multiple quality characteristics. This study deals with multivariate memory control charts to address smaller shifts in process mean vector. By adopting a new homogeneous weighting scheme, we have designed an efficient structure for multivariate process monitoring. We have also investigated the effect of an estimated variance covariance matrix on the proposed chart by considering different numbers and sizes of subgroups. We have evaluated the performance of the newly proposed multivariate chart under different numbers of quality characteristics and varying sample sizes. The performance measures used in this study include average run length, standard deviation run length, extra quadratic loss, and relative average run length. The performance analysis revealed that the proposed control chart outperforms the usual scheme under both known and estimated parameters. An application of the study proposal is also presented using a data set related to Olympic archery, for the monitoring of the location of arrows over the concentric rings on the archery board.|| In this paper, we construct and analyse the conservation laws (conserved densities) of two models that lead to oscillons; viz., in a system of two nonlinearly coupled scalar fields in (1+1)-dimensional spatiotemporal continuum and analysed a particular class of sixth-degree polynomial potentials and one in which an interaction of 'two one-dimensional spatial vector oscillons in a trap with significant transverse dimensions' occurs. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.|| The memory-type control charts are quite efficient in monitoring small and moderate shifts in process parameters. These charts, such as exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA), face the problem of inertia due to the time dependence of statistics. This issue could be solved to some extent using a break at regular/irregular intervals in plotting statistics. We have proposed this method by introducing a break feature at regular intervals, to handle the inertia problem, and found it quite useful for memory control charts. A comparative analysis of the proposal with some existing charts is also part of the study.|| In this paper, we sketch some constructions providing a link between complex-analytic geometry and nonstandard algebraic geometry via a categorical point of view. The analytic category is seen as a completed fiber of a family of nonstandard algebraic geometries by applying a standard part functor. We indicate how various notions of analytic objects fit into this context (as for example banachanalytic spaces, Kahler spaces etc.)|| In this paper, we consider the inclusion problems for maximal monotone set-valued vector fields defined on Hadamard manifolds. We discuss the equivalence between nonemptiness of solution set of the inclusion problem and the coercivity condition. The boundedness of solution set of the inclusion problem is studied. An application of our results to optimization problems in Hadamard manifolds is also presented.|| We first derive an Ekeland type variational principle for vector-valued bifunctions without assuming triangular inequality for bifunctions. Then, by using such variational principle, we derive some existence results for solutions of vector equilibrium problems and vector quasi-equilibrium problems.|| The model under consideration in this paper describes a vibrating structure of an interfacial slip and consists of three coupled hyperbolic equations in one-dimensional bounded interval under mixed homogeneous Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions. The first two equations are related to Timoshenko-type systems and the third one is subject to the dynamics of the slip. The main problem we discuss here is stabilizing the system by a viscoelastic damping generated by an infinite memory and acting only on one equation. First, we prove the existence, uniqueness and regularity of solutions using the semigroup theory. After that, we combine the energy method and the frequency domain approach to show that the infinite memory is capable alone to guarantee the strong and polynomial stability of the model, that is bringing it back to its equilibrium state with a decay rate of type t(-d), where d is a positive constant depending on the regularity of initial data. Moreover, we prove that, when the infinite memory is effective on the first equation, the model is not exponentially stable independently of the values of the parameters. However, when the infinite memory is effective on the second or the third equation, we prove that the exponential stability is equivalent to the equality between the three speeds of wave propagations. An extension of our results to the frictional damping case is also given. Our results improve and extend some existing results in the literature subject to other types of controls.|| Today's smart grid faces many challenges due to the rapid evolution of generation, distribution, and storage means which enable users to produce, store, and sell energy back to the providers. Demand response management plays a key role in achieving the objective of balancing electricity supply and demand efficiently. It also helps leveling consumption during peak hours. To do so, this paper proposes a game theoretic model for the multi-periodic smart grid demand side management problem with shifted demand. The proposed model has two major sets of players: Homeowners and electricity providers. We develop a 0-1 mixed linear programming approach to compute the Nash equilibria of the proposed game. We analyze the structure of the Nash equilibria to maintain the viability of the smart grid infrastructure. We also discuss the order relations between the users and the providers utility coefficients. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on smart grid demand response synthetic data with different size. The obtained results demonstrate the scalability of the proposed game model.|| We establish an exponential stability result for a delayed Hopfield neural network. This is proved in case one or more of the activation functions fails to satisfy the standard Lipschitz continuity condition. We use a nonlinear version of Halanay inequality, which we prove here.|| An integral domain R is an RTP domain (or has the radical trace property) (resp. an LTP domain), if I(R : I) is a radical ideal for each nonzero noninvertible ideal I (resp. I(R:I)RP=PRP for each minimal prime P of I(R : I)). Clearly each RTP domain is an LTP domain, but whether the two are equivalent is open except in certain special cases. In this paper, we study when the Nagata ring R(X) and the ring are LTP (resp. RTP) domains in different contexts of integral domains such as integrally closed domains, Noetherian and Mori domains, pseudo-valuation domains and more. We also study the descent of these notions from particular overrings of R to R itself.|| In this paper, we consider general scalar robust optimization problems and study the characterizations for optimality conditions in the general vector spaces where we do not require any topology on the considered space. By using the image space analysis and nonlinear separation function, we derive some necessary and sufficient optimality conditions, especially saddle point sufficient optimality conditions for scalar robust optimization problems. Moreover, we discuss the validity and effectiveness of our results for the shortest path problem.|| This paper is concerned with a problem of a logarithmic nonlinear wave equation with delay. The local existence result has been established using the semigroup theory. In addition, for negative initial energy, a finite-time blow-up result is proved.|| The two-parametric Mittag-Leffler function (MLF), E-alpha,E-beta, is fundamental to the study and simulation of fractional differential and integral equations. However, these functions are computationally expensive and their numerical implementations are challenging. In this paper, we present a unified framework for developing global rational approximants of E-alpha,E-beta(-x), x>0, with {(alpha,beta):0<alpha <= 1,beta >=alpha,(alpha,beta)not equal(1,1)}. This framework is based on the series definition and the asymptotic expansion at infinity. In particular, we develop three types of fourth-order global rational approximations and discuss how they could be used to approximate the inverse function. Unlike existing approximations which are either limited to MLF of one parameter or of low accuracy for the two-parametric MLF, our rational approximants are of fourth order accuracy and have low percentage error globally. For efficient utilization, we study the partial fraction decomposition and use them to approximate the two-parametric MLF with a matrix argument which arise in the solutions of fractional evolution differential and integral equations.|| A new mixed type nondifferentiable higher-order symmetric dual programs over cones is formulated. As of now, in the literature, either Wolfe-type or Mond-Weir-type nondifferentiable symmetric duals have been studied. However, we present a unified dual model and discuss weak, strong, and converse duality theorems for such programs under higher-order F- convexity/higher-order F- pseudoconvexity. Self-duality is also discussed. Our dual programs and results generalize some dual formulations and results appeared in the literature. Two non-trivial examples are given to show the uniqueness of higher-order F- convex/higher-order F- pseudoconvex functions and existence of higher-order symmetric dual programs.|| In this paper, we present a new class of higher order (Phi, rho)-V-invex functions over cones. Further, we formulate two types of higher order dual models for a vector optimization problem over cones containing support functions in objectives as well as in constraints and establish several duality results, viz., weak and strong duality results.|| Nonsmooth variational inequality problem (NVIP) and Minty nonsmooth variational inequality problem (MNVIP) in terms of a bifunction are considered in the setting of Hadamard manifolds. We first establish a Browder type fixed point theorem in the setting of Hadamard spaces, and then by using it we prove some existence results for solutions of NVIP and MNVIP. We give some relations among NVIP, MNVIP and nonsmooth optimization problem. The gap functions for NVIP and MNVIP are also studied in the setting of Hadamard manifolds.|| In this paper, we investigate the transfer of Matlis' semi-regularity and semi-coherence in trivial ring extensions issued from rings (with zero-divisors). We use the obtained results to enrich the literature with new examples of semi-regular or semi-coherent rings issued as trivial extensions and validate some questions left open in the literature.|| In this paper, we consider the variational inequality problems involving two nonexpansive mappings or a nonexpansive mapping and a weakly contraction mapping and defined over a set of fixed points of another nonexpansive mapping in the setting of Hadamard manifolds. We also consider some special cases of our problems. We first establish the existence of a solution of the considered problem. Then we propose implicit type viscosity approximation methods for solving considered problems and study their convergence results. A numerical example is given at the end of this paper in support of proposed algorithms and results. The results of this paper not only extend the results from linear structure to manifolds but also improve several known results.|| A multigrid solver for velocity tracking type control problems constrained by stationary Navier-Stokes equations is presented. Finite difference discretization is used on staggered grids. On these grids, a full multigrid method with coarsening by a factor-of-three strategy is proposed. For smoothing scheme, a distributive Gauss-Seidel scheme is used for the state and adjoint variables and a gradient update step for the control variable is applied. Numerical results validate the efficiency of the proposed multigrid algorithm.|| In this paper, we are concerned with one of the difficult class of optimization problems called the interval-valued optimization problem with vanishing constraints. Sufficient optimality conditions for a LU optimal solution are derived under generalized convexity assumptions. Moreover, appropriate duality results are discussed for a Mond-Weir type dual problem. In addition, numerical examples are given to support the sufficient optimality conditions and weak duality theorem.|| In most of the manufacturing processes, we encounter different quality characteristics of a product and process. These characteristics can be categorized into two kinds; study variables (variable of interest) and the supporting/explanatory variables. Sometime, a linear relationship might exist between the study and supporting variable, which is called simple linear profiles. This study focuses on the simple linear profiles under assorted control charting approach to detect the large, moderate and small disturbances in the process parameters. The evaluation of the proposed assorted method is assessed by using numerous performance measures, for instance, average run length, relative average run length, extra and sequential extra quadratic losses. A comparative analysis of the proposal is also carried out with some existing linear profile methods including Shewhart_3, Hotelling's T-2, EWMA_3, EWMA/R and CUSUM_3 charts. Finally, a real-life application of the proposed assorted chart is presented to monitor thermal management of diamond-copper composite.|| In this work, we develop a new method for estimating the mean and standard deviation of normally distributed populations when errors exist in the sample. The proposed estimators are asymptotically unbiased if all errors are outlying errors (i.e. all errors lie outside a region defined by the parameters of normal distribution). However, the proposed method requires having an upper bound for the percentage of errors in the sample. The proposed method is compared with the already existing and commonly used estimators in terms of bias, mean square error, and Pitman closeness criterion. The proposed method is found to be superior to the others when the sample size is not too small. A simulation study is designed to test the performance of proposed estimators when most but not all errors are outlying errors. The findings of the simulation study also indicate the superiority of the proposed method when the sample size is moderately large. As an application, we use our method in Phase I of designing a control chart to improve its performance. We apply the method on a dataset where the robustness of our proposed method is tested (and compared with the other estimators) against the presence of outlying errors in Phase I data. In the findings of the application, we notice that proposed estimators were the only ones that identified out of control data points in Phase II when Phase I samples are contaminated with the errors.|| A two-level mixed finite element method is developed and analyzed to solve the Darcy-Forchheimer equation modeling non-Darcy flows in porous media. Instead of solving a large nonlinear system of equations on a fine mesh, the two-level method provides the flexibility of solving a small nonlinear system of equations on a coarse mesh with mesh size H followed by solving one linear system of equations on a fine mesh with mesh size h. In constructing the two-level algorithm, we introduce a small positive constant epsilon to the original nonlinear term of the Darcy-Forchheimer equation to avoid difficulties associated with nondifferentiability of the Euclidean norm at zero. The priori error estimates for the velocity and pressure gradient are obtained in L-2 and L-3/2 discrete norms, respectively. These estimates state that if piecewise constant velocities and piecewise continuous, linear pressures are used, then the coarse and fine meshes are related by h = O(H-2). Numerical examples are provided to show the efficiency and accuracy of the method. Numerical results show that the twolevel Galerkin mixed finite element method is computationally more cost-effective than the standard Galerkin mixed finite element and the rate of convergence also agrees with the theoretical results.|| A time-stepping L1 scheme for subdiffusion equation with a Riemann-Liouville time fractional derivative is developed and analyzed. This is the first paper to show that the L1 scheme for the model problem under consideration is second-order accurate (sharp error estimate) over nonuniform time steps. The established convergence analysis is novel and concise. For completeness, the L1 scheme is combined with the standard Galerkin finite elements for the spatial discretization, which will then define a fully discrete numerical scheme. The error analysis for this scheme is also investigated. To support our theoretical contributions, some numerical tests are provided at the end. The considered (typical) numerical example suggests that the imposed time-graded meshes assumption can be further relaxed.|| In this paper, we study convergence analysis of a Picard type iterative algorithm for finding fixed points of nonexpansive mappings in the setting of Hilbert spaces. As an application of our result, we propose a new gradient projection algorithm for solving convex minimization problems and derive weak convergence result of such algorithm. An example is presented to illustrate our algorithm and result. As another application of our result, we present an algorithm for solving split feasibility problems and discuss the weak convergence of the algorithm.|| In this paper, we extend the LPI property (that is, every locally principal ideal in an integral domain is invertible) to rings with zero-divisors and we study the class of commutative rings in which every regular locally principal ideal is invertible called LPI rings. We investigate the stability of this property under homomorphic image, and its transfer to various contexts of constructions such as direct products, amalgamation of rings and trivial ring extensions. Our results generate examples which enrich the current literature with new and original families of rings that satisfy this property.|| In this paper, we study generalized multiple-set split feasibility problems (in short, GMSSFP) in the frame work of p-uniformly convex real Banach spaces which are also uniformly smooth. We construct an iterative algorithm which is free from an operator norm and prove its strong convergence to a solution of GMSSFP, that is, a solution of convex problem and a common fixed point of a countable family of Bregman asymptotically quasi-nonexpansive mappings without requirement for semi-compactness on the mappings. We illustrate our algorithm and convergence result by a numerical example.|| The monitoring of process variability is an important feature to get optimal output from a process. Control charts are vital tools used for efficient process monitoring. The commonly used types of charts include Shewhart, cumulative sum and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control charts. This study focuses on dispersion control charts using some efficient transformation for small and medium instabilities. We intend to propose an assorted method to monitor a range of disturbances in process dispersion, using the well-known max approach. We have used several measures to evaluate the suggested assorted control chart. Based on these measures, we have compared the proposed assorted method with many existing charts. The study proposal outperforms the existing counterparts in detecting various amounts of shifts in process dispersion. Finally, a real-life application of the proposed chart is demonstrated to monitor the flow width measurements in a hard-bake process.|| Shewhart S-2 control chart is one of the most commonly used tools to monitor the dispersion of a process. In this article, we evaluate the performance of S-2 control chart when the unknown parameter is estimated from Phase-I samples. Average ARL and standard deviation of ARL metrics are used to evaluate the performance. In the first stage of the study, new control limit coefficients are derived so that the average ARL is equal to the pre-fixed ARL, ie, 370. Secondly, different proportion of outliers is contaminated into Phase-I samples, and the resulting elevated average ARL and standard deviation of ARL are measured. Finally, the application of Tukey's outlier detector is proposed with Phase-I samples so that the elevation caused by the outliers can be controlled and the average ARL can be pulled back close to the pre-fixed ARL. For illustration, the proposed procedures are applied to a data on compressive strength of parts manufactured by an injection molding process.|| We developed a novel direct optimization method to solve distributed optimal control of viscous Burgers' equation over a finite-time horizon by minimizing the distance between the state function and a desired target state profile along with the energy of the control. Through a novel linearization strategy, well-conditioned integral reformulations, optimal Gegenbauer barycentric quadratures, and nodal discontinuous Galerkin discretizations, the method reduces such optimal control problems into finite-dimensional, nonlinear programming problems subject to linear algebraic system of equations and discrete mixed path inequality constraints that can be solved easily using standard optimization software. The proposed method produces ""an auxiliary control function"" that provides a useful model to explicitly define the optimal controller of the state variable. We present an error analysis of the semidiscretization and full discretization of the weak form of the reduced equality constraint system equations to demonstrate the exponential convergence of the method. The accuracy of the proposed method is examined using two numerical examples for various target state functions in the existence/absence of control bounds. The proposed method is exponentially convergent in both space and time, thus producing highly accurate approximations using a significantly small number of collocation points.|| The availability of some extra information, along with the actual variable of interest, may be easily accessible in different practical situations. A sensible use of the additional source may help to improve the properties of statistical techniques. In this study, we focus on the estimators for calibration and intend to propose a setup where we reply only on first two moments instead of modeling the whole distributional shape. We have proposed an estimator for linear calibration problems and investigated it under normal and skewed environments. We have partitioned its mean squared error into intrinsic and estimation components. We have observed that the bias and mean squared error of the proposed estimator are function of four dimensionless quantities. It is to be noticed that both the classical and the inverse estimators become the special cases of the proposed estimator. Moreover, the mean squared error of the proposed estimator and the exact mean squared error of the inverse estimator coincide. We have also observed that the proposed estimator performs quite well for skewed errors as well. The real data applications are also included in the study for practical considerations.|| This paper seeks an answer to the following question: Let R be a Noetherian ring with depth(R) <= 1. When is every ideal isomorphic to a trace ideal? We prove that for a local Noetherian domain R with depth(R) <= 1, every ideal is isomorphic to a trace ideal if and only if either R is a DVR or R is one-dimensional divisorial domain, M is a principal ideal of M-1 and M-1 posses the property that every ideal of M-1 is isomorphic to a trace ideal of M-1. Next., we globalize our result by showing that. a Noetherian domain R with depth(R) <= 1 has every ideal isomorphic to a trace ideal if and only if either R is a PID or R is one-dimensional divisorial domain, every invertible ideal of R is principal and for every non-invertible maximal ideal M of R, M is a principal ideal of M-1 and every ideal of M-1 is isomorphic to a trace ideal of M-1. We close the paper by examining some classes of non-Noetherian domains with this property to provide a large family of original examples.|| In this work, we propose an iterative scheme to approach common fixed point(s) of a finite family of generalized multi-valued nonexpansive mappings in a CAT(0) space. We establish and prove convergence theorems for the algorithm. The results are new and interesting in the theory of CAT (0) spaces and are the analogues of corresponding ones in uniformly convex Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces.|| This paper deals with reductions of ideals in various settings of pullback constructions. Precisely, we investigate reductions of several types of ideals in both generic and classical pullbacks. We also characterize pullbacks where reductions of a class of ideals extend to reductions of their respective extended ideals. All results are illustrated with original examples.|| Considering the plane symmetric non-static spacetimes in the context of f(R) gravity, we obtain exact solutions of the vacuum field equations by assuming constant scalar curvature. By suitable transformations, it is shown that the obtained solutions can be transformed to Bianchi type V, a type of Taub's and the De Sitter solutions. Of particular interest is a solution that represents a model that has initial singularity and under an appropriate transformation can be converted to a Bianchi-type V model. This solution, like the Bianchi type V model, leads to predictions about evolution in the sense of an expanding universe starting from an initial singularity. In this context, we show that the expansion of the universe in f(R) gravity can be explained without invoking the cosmological constant Lambda.|| We study Moudafi's iterative algorithm for an alpha-nonexpansive mapping and a fundamentally nonexpansive mapping in the framework of a convex metric space. We prove Delta-convergence and strong convergence results for the algorithm to a common fixed point of the mappings. Our results are new and are also valid in CAT(0) spaces and Banach spaces, simultaneously.|| Anomalous diffusion and long-range spatial interactions in anisotropic media could be captured by considering the Riesz fractional derivatives rather than the classical Laplacian. While analytical solutions of the resulting fractional reaction-diffusion models may not be available, the numerical methods for approximating them are challenging. In this paper, fourth-order L-stable (ETDRK04) and A-stable (ETDRK22) linearly implicit predictor-corrector type time-stepping methods are presented. These methods are implemented on two-dimensional Riesz fractional nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations with smooth and non-smooth initial data. Three types of nonlinear reaction-diffusion models are considered: Allen-Cahn equation with cubic nonlinearity, Fisher's equation with quadratic nonlinearity, and Enzyme Kinetics equation with rational nonlinearity. Fourth-order temporal convergence rate of the methods is proved analytically and computed numerically. Profiles of the numerical solutions corresponding to different orders and rates of diffusion are included. Computational efficiency of the ETDRK04 and ETDRK22 methods over the well known Cox-Matthews ETDRK4 is presented. The superiority of the provided methods, in terms of computational accuracy, efficiency, and reliability, is demonstrated through the numerical experiments. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Then we show that both graphical versions of the Ekeland variational principle and Caristi's fixed point theorem are equivalent. In addition, we applied our main result on a differential structure Banach space.|| Let (X, vertical bar vertical bar center dot vertical bar vertical bar) be a Banach space. Let C be a nonempty, bounded, closed and convex subset of X and let T : C -> C be a G-monotone nonexpansive mapping. In this work, it is shown that the Mann iteration sequence defined by x(n+1) = t(n)T(x(n)) + (1 - t(n))x(n), n = 1, 2,..., proves the existence of a fixed point of G-monotone nonexpansive mappings.|| Partial differential equations (PDEs) arise naturally in a wide variety of scientific areas and applications, and their numerical solutions are highly indispensable in many cases. Typical spectral/pseudospectral (PS) methods for solving PDEs work well only for regular domains such as rectangles or disks: however, the application of these methods to irregular domains is not straightforward and difficult enough to consider them less appealing as numerical tools. This research paper endeavors to take advantage of these methods in complex domains by introducing a novel, high-order numerical method that brings into play domain embedding into a regular, square computational domain in combination with integral reformulation, fully exponentially convergent Fourier PS collocation, and the Fourier-Continuation (FC)-Gram method integrated with a novel predictor-corrector-continuation algorithm to improve the accuracy of the extrapolated data. We developed some new formulas to construct the first- and second-order Fourier integration matrices (FIMs) based on equally-spaced nodes within the interval of integration. Modified FIMs were also developed to compute integral approximations of smooth, periodic functions when the upper limits of integration are any random points in the interval of integration. An algorithm for the fast and economic construction of the first-order FIM was also derived. A rounding error analysis based on numerical simulations demonstrates that the rounding errors in the calculation of the elements of the developed FIMs of size N are roughly of order less than or equal to O(Nu(R)), where u(R) approximate to 2.22 x 10(-16) is the unit round-off of the double-precision floating-point system. The powerful features of the proposed method are illustrated through the study of the numerical solution of two-dimensional linear PDEs of Poisson type with constant coefficients and two different sets of boundary conditions. Two test problems are presented to demonstrate the overall capabilities of the proposed method. The current research paper investigations can be very useful when dealing with more complicated problems such as nonlinear PDE5 in complex domains, or optimal control problems governed by linear/nonlinear PDE5 in complex domains.

7,Center of Research Excellence in Corrosion,Research Institue,131,1086,60,39,24,48.78,31.71,19.51,43.51,27.48,29.01,57,36,38,"|| Objective of this study is to develop a highly effective and durable phosphorus based epoxy resin as anticorrosive coating material for carbon steel in 3% NaCl medium. The hexaglycidylN,N ',N ''-tris (4,4 '-ethylene dianiline) phosphoramide (HGTEDPA) was characterized using spectral methods. The anticorrosive formulation (HGTEDPA-MDA) was synthesized using HGTEDPA curing with 4,4 '-methylenedianiline (MDA). The formulation (HGTEDPA-MDA) coated steel specimens were exposed to UV radiation for a specific durable (189 days) and durability of the formulation was tested along with its inhibition effectiveness. The anticorrosive property of the formulation was evaluated using electrochemical (electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization (PDP)) methods. Results showed that HGTEDPA-MDA coating improved the corrosion resistance value even after exposing 180 days to the UV radiation. PDP study suggested that HGTEDPA-MDA before and after UV radiations acted as mainly anodic and cathodic type of inhibitor, respectively. The EIS and PDP results were corroborated with density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamic simulations (MDS) methods and a reasonable good agreement was observed. DFT study revealed that HGTEDPA-MDA interacts with the metallic surface using donor-acceptor interactions. MDS study revealed that HGTEDPA-MDA spontaneously interacts with steel surface and adsorb using horizontal orientation.|| In this study, Kola nut extract (KE) was evaluated for inhibiting ability towards low carbon steel corrosion in 1 M HCl solution using weight loss and electrochemical techniques. The surface of the corroded carbon steel was examined by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Elemental composition of the corrosion products and/or adsorbed inhibitor film on the carbon steel surface was determined with the aid of an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) experiments were also performed to get information about the interaction of KE with the carbon steel surface. It was found that KE exhibited good corrosion protection property. From weight loss technique, corrosion rate was reduced from 0.387 to 0.054 mm/year by 700 ppm of KE at room temperature after 24 h immersion and this corresponded to inhibition efficiency (IE) of 86%. The IE however depreciated with rise in temperature. FTIR results reveal that KE interacted with the carbon steel surface through the O and N heteroatoms of its phytoconstituents. FTIR spectroscopy, UV-vis, SEM, AFM, and EDX data provided proof of KE adsorption on the steel surface as reason for the corrosion inhibition.|| Present study deals with the synthesis, characterization and corrosion inhibition effect of a hexafunctional cyclotriphosphazene derivative, namely 2,2,4,4,6,6-hexakis(oxiran-2-ylmethoxy)-1,3,5,2 delta, 4 delta,6 delta-triazatriphosphinine(HPGCP)for copper in 3 wt% NaCl medium. The synthesized HPGCP was characterized using numerous spectral techniques such as H-1, C-13, P-31 NMR (Nuclear magnetic resonance) and Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) methods. Anti-corrosive effect of the HPGCP was measured using electrochemical and computational methods. Results showed that HPGCP exhibited highest protection efficiency of 95% at as low as 10(-3) M concentration. Polarization studies showed that HPGCP acted as mixed type inhibitor and its adsorption obeyed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model. Density Functional Theory (DFT) based computational studies demonstrate that HPGCP interacts with copper surface using donor-acceptor interactions inwhich three nitrogen atoms and six p-electrons of the cyclotriphosphazene ring play significant role in metalinhibitor interactions. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations study demonstrated that HPGCP spontaneously interacts withmetallic surface using its electron rich centers and acquires the planar orientation. Experimental results were well corroborated with the computational results. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Hence, enhancing the clinical performance of bio-implants is being widely focused worldwide. Herein, we report that nanostructured silver (Ag) coatings prepared on medical grade 316L stainless steel (SS) substrates are promising implant/surgical materials for orthopedic applications. Homogeneous nanoparticle-shaped silver thin films as a function of growth time (15 to 60 minutes) were developed at a temperature of 450 degrees C through aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) using a silver (I) acetate solution. All silver films were characterized using various surface and structural analysis techniques to confirm the phase and stoichiometric purity of the coating. Scanning electrochemical microscopy experiments were conducted to inspect the initial degradation of silver films on 316L SS substrates in simulated body fluid (SBF). Corrosion assessments in the SBF medium indicated that all the coated 316L SS substrates under study exhibited higher corrosion resistance than the uncoated ones; in particular, Ag films grown in 30 minutes showed the highest corrosion resistance among the other silver coatings produced under different conditions. The better corrosion performance of the Ag-30 sample was attributed to the dense, compact silver layer obtained in 30 minutes of deposition utilizing the AACVD technique.|| Three glucose derivatives, namely Ethylenediamine-modified glucose, Tetramethylenediamine-modified glucose, and Hexamethylenediamine-modified glucose with three different carbon chain lengths were synthesized using environmentally benign and low-cost reactants at ambient temperature. The synthesized derivatives were evaluated as inhibitors for mild steel corrosion in 1 M HCl using electrochemical, surface analysis (XPS, AFM and contact angle), as well as computational (DFT) techniques. The obtained results suggest that the synthesized glucose derivatives significantly mitigate the corrosion of mild steel and show a rise in the inhibition efficiency with increasing inhibitor dosage. The inhibitor adsorption obeyed the Langmuir isotherm. The XPS analyses provided an elucidation on the interaction of the inhibitors with the steel substrate. The DFT studies showed that the protonated forms of the inhibitors act more prominently compared to the neutral form. The inhibitor HMG having the alkyl chain with six carbon atoms exhibited the highest inhibition performance of 95% at 22.71 x 10(-5) mol L-1 .|| Chitosan was chemically functionalized using aminotriazolethiol in a facile single-step synthesis. The macromolecule was evaluated as an inhibitor for corrosion of stainless steel in 3.5% NaCl solution. A detailed electrochemical investigation employing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) was performed, which showed that the inhibitor acts by adsorption on the steel surface and shows a mixed type behavior with the prevalence of cathodic behavior. The new inhibitor aminotriazolethiol-modified chitosan (ATT-Cht) exhibited excellent water solubility and behaved as an efficient inhibitor against corrosion of stainless steel in 3.5% NaCl showing a corrosion inhibition efficiency of 97.8% at a concentration as low as 100 mg L-1. The results of surface studies using scanning electron microscopy along with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy supported the adsorption of the inhibitor on the steel surface.

The coating formulation embedded with yttrium(III) oxide exhibited optimum low surface roughness, good adhesion to metallic substrates with elevated thermal stability, and enhanced barrier properties for mild steel substrates in 3.5 wt.% NaCl medium compared to the parent coating. Scanning electrochemical microscopy analyses indicated a dense, crack-free, and homogeneous nature for the coating layer on the steel. The coating's degradation was evaluated using the scanning electrochemical microscopic technique.|| Epoxy coatings reinforced with 1-20 wt% micronized waste tire rubber (WTR) for improved mechanical and tribological properties were investigated. The hardness was improved as compared to the pristine epoxy coating by 22% at an optimum loading of 5 wt% WTR. The coefficient of friction of the epoxy composite coatings reduced considerably after reinforcing with WTR for all loadings. Similarly, the wear resistance was improved by over 70% for up to a loading of 10 wt% WTR. However, the mechanical and wear properties deteriorated at higher WTR loadings. The WTR reinforced epoxy coatings exhibited promising properties at optimum loading of 5 wt%. The effect of load, sliding speed, temperature and the ensuing wear mechanisms were analyzed and discussed.|| Due to strict environmental regulations, the use of toxic chemicals as corrosion inhibitors for the oil-well acidizing is restricted. Environmentally benign Vanillin-modified chitosan (Van-Cht) is synthesized using a microwave-induced green synthetic protocol and thoroughly characterized by FTIR and NMR spectroscopy. The inhibitor has been evaluated for the first time for carbon steel in 15% HCl. The corrosion inhibition performance was assayed using weight loss and electrochemical methods complemented with the surface analysis of the corroded carbon steel samples without and with the inhibitor immersed in the corrosive medium. Results obtained showed that the Van-Cht acted by adsorption on the surface of carbon steel to inhibit corrosion and exhibited a mixed-type behavior with cathodic predominance. The adsorption of Van-Cht on the carbon steel surface obeyed the Langmuir isotherm. The excellent corrosion inhibition efficiency of > 98% observed at a concentration of 500 mg L-1. Surface analysis using SEM and FTIR-ATR measurements supported the adsorption of Van-Cht inhibitor on the carbon steel surface. The pKa analysis proved that the inhibitor Van-Cht exists mainly in the protonated form at the experimental pH. The density functional theory (DFT) analysis proved that the protonated form of the Van-Cht inhibitor behaves better compared to that of the Van and neutral Van-Cht. [GRAPHICS] .|| Time-evolution study of 2-(2-pyridyl) benzimidazole (2PB) as CO2 corrosion inhibitor for API X60 steel under hydrodynamic conditions in a synthetic brine solution has been undertaken. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) techniques were employed for this study. The results indicate that 2.56 mM of 2PB could provide up to 88.3 % inhibition efficiency after 12 h at 4000 rpm in the synthetic brine solution. The addition of 0.14 mM thiobarbituric acid (TBA) significantly enhances 2PB performance to 95.6 % using PDP. ATR-IR, SEM and optical image characterizations confirm that 2PB adsorption suppresses the localized corrosion of the steel.|| Herein, graphene oxide (GO) was chemically functionalized with polyethyleneimine (PEI) in a single step to obtain PEI-GO, which was characterized via FTIR spectroscopy, SEM, and TEM. Additionally, for the first time, PEI-GO was employed for the corrosion mitigation of carbon steel in a solution of 15% HCl. The corrosion performance of the inhibitor was evaluated by utilizing weight loss tests, electrochemical measurements with impedance analysis, electrochemical frequency modulation, and potentiodynamic polarization studies. Thorough surface analysis was performed using 3D profilometry and static water contact angle measurements. PEI-GO was adsorbed on the steel surface and showed mixed-type corrosion inhibition behavior with the prevalence of cathodic characteristics. Additionally, potassium iodide was incorporated in the acid solution as a synergistic agent to enhance the corrosion inhibition behavior of PEI-GO. The obtained results showed that PEI-GO alone provided a high corrosion inhibition efficiency of 88.24% at a temperature of 65 degrees C and in the presence of KI, it showed an I.E. of 95.77% due to their synergistic effect. These interesting results demonstrate that PEI-GO can act as a potential corrosion inhibitor in acidizing conditions. The DFT-based computational studies showed that the inhibitor functioned in both its neutral and protonated forms.|| Super-Hydrophobic (SH) surfaces possessed low free energy and are highly resistant to wetting. These properties of SH surfaces made them suitable for engineering applications like waterproofing, anticorrosion coatings, anti-icing finish etc. Asphalt binder that is widely adopted as civil engineering material for waterproofing application is only hydrophobic, not SH. In this study, recycled Low Density and High Density Poly-Ethylene (rLDPE & rHDPE) were employed to transform asphalt surface from hydrophobic to SH. Micronized rLDPE and rHDPE powders were obtained by grinding and sieving. The morphologies, thermal characteristics, and particles distributions of the various powders were analyzed using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC); Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), and laser diffraction method respectively. The asphalt surfaces were modified by thermally fusing the micronized rLDPE and rHDPE at 100 degrees C for 15, 30, and 45 min curing durations. Roughness and Water Contact Angle (WCA) of the rLDPE and rHDPE treated asphalt surfaces were analyzed using 3D optical profilometer and sessile drop video contact angle system, respectively. The bonding at asphalt-rLDPE/rHDPE interfaces, and surface morphologies of the rLDPE and rHDPE asphalt surfaces were studied using SEM. Surface roughness decreases with increase in curing duration due to settling and thermal shrinkage of rLDPE/rHDPE particles. The WCA of the asphalt was increased by at least 35% for just 15 min curing duration. However, longer curing duration was found to yield a more resilient treated surface. The increase in WCA transformed the asphalt surfaces from hydrophobic to SH. Due to the elongated and fuzzy morphology of the rLDPE powder, in addition to its higher thermal sensitivity, it was able to form a better surface texture that facilitate higher WCA than the rHDPE. Statistical analysis of variance was conducted to assess the extent at which the micronized powder types and curing duration affect the surface roughness and WCA. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we are exploring the green synthesis of 4,4'-((4-methoxyphenyl)methylene)bis(3-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-ol) (PZ-1) and 4,4'-((4-nitrophenyl)methylene)bis(3-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-ol) (PZ-2) under ultrasonic irradiation and its potential application for N80 steel corrosion mitigation in 15% HCl. The corrosion inhibition investigation was performed by open circuit potential (OCP), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), linear polarization (LPR), potentiodynamic polarization (PDP), electrochemical frequency modulation (EFM), and electrochemical frequency modulation trend (EFMT), weight loss, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD). The EIS and PDP results suggests an increased impedance in presence of PZs and mixed nature of inhibitor action respectively. The protection efficiency (eta%) are 98.4% (PZ-1) and 94.3% (PZ-2). The results of EFMT provides the average decrease in corrosion rate and corrosion current density (i(corr)).The surface analysis suggests a protective layer of PZs. DFT analysis reveals that PZ-1 with lower value of Delta E acts as a better inhibitor compared to PZ-2. MD study supports a stronger binding and interaction ability of PZ-1 than PZ-2.

The antimicrobial effect of the nanofluids against Gram positive, Bacillus licheniformis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Bacillus cereus, and Micrococcus luteus, and Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas citronellolis, and Escherichia coli bacteria has been studied. The nanoparticles were polydispersed in the chitosan matrix and are highly stable. The zeta potential of the silver nanoparticles in DPLE- and HEL-mediated composites is +46 mV and +56 mV, respectively. The FTIR results reveal that the free carboxylate groups in the plant biomaterial took part in stabilization process. HEL is a stronger reducing agent than DPLE and nanoparticles generated with HEL are smaller (8.0-36 nm) than those produced with DPLE (10-43 nm). DPLE- and HEL-mediated composites effectively inhibit the growth of the studied bacteria but HEL-mediated composite exhibited higher effect. The higher antimicrobial activity of HEL-mediated composite is linked to the smaller nanoparticles. The foregoing results indicate that HEL extract can be used in the green production of potential antimicrobial chitosan/silver nanofluids for biomedical and packaging applications.|| A benzimidazole derivative, 2-(2-bromophenyl)-1-methyl-1H-benzimidazole (2BPB) has been studied as a corrosion inhibitor for Cu-Ni 70/30 and 90/10 alloys in 1 mol/dm(3) HCl solution at low and high temperatures using the weight loss, electrochemical (potentiodynamic polarization (PDP), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), & cyclic voltammetry (CV)), and surface characterization (scanning electron microscopy (SEM) & Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)) techniques. The effect of immersion time (up to 72 h) and addition of iodide ions on the inhibition efficiency of 2BPB have also been investigated. At low temperature, 1.0 g/L 2BPB inhibits Cu-Ni 70/30 and 90/10 alloys by 88.9 +/- 4.8% and 57.5 +/- 1.3%, respectively. The performance of 2BPB improves with increase in immersion time and addition of iodide ions but slightly depreciates with rise in temperature. 2BPB acts as a mixed type corrosion inhibitor and adsorbs on the alloys surfaces through physical adsorption mechanism. SEM and FTIR results confirm the adsorption of 2BPB on the alloys surfaces. 2BPB is a potential low toxic candidate for the formulation of acid corrosion inhibitor for Cu-Ni alloys.|| An imidazoline, 2-heptadecyl-1-[2-(octadecanoylamino)ethyl]-2- imidazoline (QSI) with -C17H35 as the tail chain length was synthesized, characterized, and studied as corrosion inhibitor for low carbon steel in 15% HCl solution under static and hydrodynamic conditions. Influence of addition of KI, temperature, and chain length of pendant hydrocarbon on inhibition efficiency (eta) was also examined. It is found that, QSI exhibits a mixed type behavior but fairly inhibited the corrosion of low carbon steel in the studied medium. The maximum concentration studied (400 mg/L) afforded eta of <50%. Addition of KI to QSI synergistically enhanced the corrosion inhibition performance of QSI, upgrading the. to approximately 90%. Increase in the system temperature increases the eta of both QSI and QSI + KI. From the variation of eta with temperature and the calculated corrosion kinetic parameters, chemical adsorption is proposed as the adsorption mechanism of the additives. QSI performs better under hydrodynamic condition than static condition eta However, the corrosion resistance of the metal decreases at rotation speed higher than 1000 rpm. Inhibition efficiency of imidazoline decreases as the length of the hydrocarbon pendant chain increases. Imidazoline compounds with -C13H27 and -C15H31 as the length of the pendant group hydrocarbon perform better than QSI with -C17H35.|| Hypothesis: There is a scarcity of available literature studies on the inhibition of aqueous corrosion using graphene and graphene oxide (GO) due to their poor aqueous solubility. The abundance of oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of GO offers promising aspects for its chemical modification. Accordingly, we herein report the application of bis(2-aminoethyl)amine-modified graphene oxide (B2AA-GO) as a corrosion inhibitor for carbon steel in industrial oil-well acidizing conditions. Experiments: B2AA was used to modify the graphene oxide (GO) chemically and characterized using FTIR, SEM, and TEM. The corrosion evaluations were undertaken in 15% HCI using weight loss, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and potentiodynamic polarization techniques supported by a thorough surface analysis using water contact angle measurements, FTIR, and atomic force microscopy. Findings: It observed that the B2AA-GO acted by adsorption on the metal surface and exhibited a mixed type of nature with cathodic prevalence. The results showed that the chemically modified GO exhibits excellent inhibition behavior showing 90.27% corrosion inhibition efficiency up to 65 degrees C. Furthermore, iodide ions were introduced to improve the inhibition efficiency of the GO via synergistic action and inhibition efficiency of 96.77% was obtained at 65 degrees C. The obtained results show that the chemically modified GO is a promising corrosion inhibitor in the acidizing environment. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The formulation (TGEDA-MDA) consists of an epoxy resin (TGEDA) cured with a methylene dianiline (MDA). The anticorrosive performance of coating was investigated using potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods. Investigated TGEDA-MDA acted as effective anti-corrosive coating with protection efficiency of approximately 93%. PDP results showed that TGEDA-MDA mainly inhibited the cathodic reactions. The experimental results were supported by several computational approaches such as density functional theory (DFT), molecular dynamic (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to explore the interactions between the TGEDA-MDA and the steel surface. Computational results showed that TGEDA-MDA possesses a strong adhesion onto the carbon steel surface and acquires the flat or horizontal orientation.|| Temporary rust preventives (RPs) are essential in several industrial applications in protecting the metallic structures from corrosion during manufacture, storage and transportation. This review provides a comprehensive account of research advancements in temporary RPs. The review starts with a brief introduction to RPs and their various types. 2 gives an account of old reported works as several interesting works in this area appeared before the 1980s. 3 explains the recent R & D on RPs where a separate section on patents are added as most of the latest reports are patented information. 4 discusses different electrochemical methods employed in studying RPs. The review ends with a short description of commercial RPs. Future scopes of R & D are also presented.|| The crude extract of Pterocarpus santalinoides leaves (PSLE) extracted using water, ethanol, and methanol as the extraction solvent has been studied as inhibitor for low carbon steel in 1 moL/dm(3) HCl solution using electrochemical approaches at 25 degrees C and 60 degrees C. The results obtained reveal that, PSLE extract has the capacity to effectively suppress the dissolution of the studied substrate. The inhibition performance of PSLE is a function of concentration, temperature, and extraction solvent. Corrosion inhibition is in the order: ethanolic extract > methanolic extract > aqueous extract. With 0.7 g/L PSLE, inhibition efficiency of >90% has been obtained at 60 degrees C. Based on calculated values of adsorption parameters and UV-vis results, it is proposed that PSLE molecules chemically interacted with the substrate surface. PSLE extract suppressed both the rate of cathodic and anodic reactions according to the PDP results. However, aqueous PSLE extract inhibited anodic corrosion reactions predominantly while ethanolic and methanolic extracts mainly inhibited the cathodic corrosion reactions. Surface characterization studies via SEM, EDAX, and AFM provide experimental evidence to the claim of interaction and presence of PSLE molecules on the studied substrate surface.|| A facile single-step synthesis was performed to cross-link chitosan with thiocarbohydrazide to yield thiocarbohydrazide-chitosan (TC-Cht) which was for the first time evaluated as an inhibitor for corrosion of stainless steel in 3.5% NaCl solution. A comprehensive electrochemical analysis employing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), potentiodynamic polarization (PDP), and cyclic voltammetry (CV) was undertaken and showed that the TC-Cht acts by adsorption on the steel surface and exhibits mixed type behavior with predominantly cathodic nature. The adsorption of TC-Cht molecules on the surface of stainless steel followed the Langmuir isotherm. The TC-Cht showed a high inhibition efficiency of >94% at 500 mg L-1 concentration. Surface investigation using SEM and EDX supported the inhibitor adsorption on the steel surface.|| A magnesium-based metal matrix composite incorporated with 2.5 wt.% TiB2 has been fabricated using spark plasma sintering for the first time. The Taguchi design approach was used to analyze the significant influences of sintering parameters such as the temperature, pressure, and time on the physical and mechanical properties of Mg-based composites. Analysis of variance was used to investigate the effect of each sintering parameter. X-ray diffraction and field-emission scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy were used for structure and microstructure analysis. Rockwell hardness (HR) and Vickers hardness (HV) were used to evaluate the mechanical properties of the composite. The results showed that, in the case of microhardness, all the sintering parameters were controlling factors, and the sintering temperature was the most significant factor. The maximum values obtained for the densification, Rockwell hardness, and Vickers hardness were 100%, 62.18 HR, and 58.6 HV, respectively.|| The three substituted triazines were synthesized by ultrasound irradiation method and characterized by FTIR, C-13 NMR, and H-1 NMR. The corrosion inhibition behavior of the synthesized inhibitors on N80 steel in 15% HCl was studied using electrochemical analyses and weight loss methods. All three inhibitors exhibited excellent corrosion inhibition performance, and the best inhibition effect was shown by TZ-3 (93.2% at 800 mg/L). EIS measurements suggest that the corrosion inhibition process is a charge transfer controlled. The PDP results indicated that all the triazines are mixed-type inhibitors. Langmuir adsorption model is the best fit among the other tested isotherms. These molecules can act as promising acidizing corrosion inhibitors for the oil gas industry. FTIR, AFM, and UV-vis studies corroborate the adsorption of inhibitor molecules over the metal surface.|| Seven natural polymers namely, chitosan (CHI), dextran (Dex), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), sodium alginate (ALG), pectin (PEC), hydroxylethyl cellulose (HEC), and Gum Arabic (GA) were screened for anticorrosion property towards AZ31 Mg alloy in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution. CHI, Dex, CMC, PEC, and GA accelerated the corrosion while ALG and HEC moderately inhibited the corrosion of the alloy. HEC and ALG (1 g/L) protected the alloy by 64.13 % and 58.27 %, respectively. Two inhibitor cocktails consisting of either HEC or ALG, KI, and Date palm seed oil have been formulated. HEC- and ALG-formulations inhibited the alloy corrosion by 80.56% and 77.43 %, respectively from EIS technique. Surface observation studies using SECM, AFM, SEM, and EDX agreed with other experimental results revealing effective corrosion inhibition by the formulations. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, FTIR, and UV-vis results disclose that Mg(OH)(2) co-existed with adsorbed inhibitor complexes.|| Hypothesis: In the present time, there is enormous need for environmentally friendly and effective corrosion inhibitor for the acidizing process, During acidization 15% hydrochloric acid is used, which causes corrosion of N80 steel. Experiments: The present study aims at the synthesis of environmentally benign corrosion inhibitor, namely 2-amino-4-(5-hydroxy-3-methyl-1H-pyrazole-4-yl)-4H-chromene-3-carbonitrile (PCP), and corrosion inhibition evaluation for N80 steel in 15% HCl. The inhibition potential of PCP was examined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), potentiodynamic polarization (PDP), density functional theory (DFT), and molecular dynamics simulation (MSD). The surface morphology of N80 steel samples was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), contact angle measurement, UV-vis spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Findings: The EIS measurements disclosed that PCP inhibits corrosion via kinetic controlled process. PDP results confirmed that PCP is a mixed type inhibitor and reduces the corrosion process effectively at 400 mg/L concentration with 98.4% efficiency. The adsorption of PCP followed Langmuir isotherm. Surface analysis by SEM, AFM, contact angle measurement, and UV-vis spectroscopy supports PCP adsorption over the N80 steel surface. The DFT study explores the adsorption and reactive regions of the PCP molecules. The MSD reveals that the diffusion co-efficient of the corrosive species in inhibited solution is less as compared to uninhibited. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In 3.5% NaCl saturated with carbon dioxide at 65 degrees C corrosion inhibition effect was analyzed using weight loss, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) methods. The PDP results revealed that SCSB acts as a mixed type inhibitor and reduces the corrosion process effectively at 150 mg L-1 concentration with an inhibition efficiency of 95.2% and corrosion rate of 0.444 mm/y. EIS measurements suggest that the corrosion inhibition process is kinetically controlled. Langmuir adsorption model is the best fit among the other tested isotherms. The surface analysis was carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning Kelvin probe (SKP), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to corroborate the formation of inhibitor film on the metal surface. Computational studies showed the effective adsorption of the protonated form of inhibitor. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The use of corrosion inhibitors is one of the most economical methods of controlling sweet corrosion. Corrosion inhibitors applied under bottom-hole temperatures up to 100 degrees C are usually stable and generally show no technology-related problems in their performance. Above this temperature, however, the literature report of corrosion inhibitors is relatively scarce. This poses a serious challenge to controlling sweet corrosion as drilling operations now drift to deeper wells with higher temperature and pressure. Consequently, no scientific or patent review on corrosion inhibitors for sweet corrosion at high temperature is visible in the literature. Therefore, a thorough review of high-temperature sweet corrosion inhibitors is important. Herein, we review scientific research publications and patents related to corrosion inhibitors reported for sweet corrosion of steel at temperature at least 90 degrees C. Nitrogen-based compounds are the most widely used inhibitor chemistries. Research gaps still exists on localized and high total dissolved solids (TDS) brine high temperature sweet corrosion inhibitors.

Microalgae have several merits, including their nontoxic nature, fast growth rate, growth not being dependent on the supply of fresh water, potential for biodegradability, and not requiring arable land for their growth. The exploration of novel frontiers to establish large-scale operations is vital for economically feasible biodiesel production, taking advantage of these favorable attributes. This review is focused on the recent development of the enzymatic transformation of microalgal oils into biodiesel. The areas addressed in this work include (i) microalgae and their lipid content, (ii) maximization of lipid productivity and lipid extraction, (iii) biodiesel production by enzymatic transesterification, (iv) enzyme kinetics, (v) factors affecting enzymatic transesterification, and (vi) immobilized enzymes and their limitations. In addition, various aspects of free enzyme and its potential future applications are discussed. This review also highlights a number of strategies using ionic liquids (ILs) for the successful production of microalgal biodiesel. The present study suggests that free enzyme has a greater potential than immobilized enzyme for the transesterification of bio-oils containing phospholipids into biodiesel.|| High-performance, fluidizable VOx/Ce-meso-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by an excessive solvent approach. The prepared catalysts were characterized using various physicochemical techniques in order to secure desired properties. XRD, Raman, and FTIR analyses indicated the presence of amorphous VOx phases on Ce-meso-Al2O3. Nitrogen adsorption isotherm analysis confirmed a mesoporous framework with a high surface area of the catalysts. H-2-TPR reduction showed an active and stable behavior of the catalysts in repeated reduction and oxidation cycles. The NH3-TPD and NH3 desorption kinetics analysis revealed that the synthesized catalysts have moderate acidities and low activation energies of NH3 desorption, suggesting weak metal-support interactions. The VOx/Ce-meso-Al2O3 catalysts were evaluated for n-butane oxidative dehydrogenation (BODH) using a fluidized CREC riser simulator under gas-phase oxygen-free conditions. The reaction time and reaction temperature were varied between 5 and 25 s and 450-575 degrees C, respectively. It was found that BODH with 0.2 wt % cerium-doped VOx/meso-Al2O3 catalysts gives the highest selectivity (62.3%) of C4 olefins with a conversion of 10.6% at 450 degrees C and 5 s. Furthermore, the fluidizable VOx/Ce-meso-Al2O3 catalyst showed a stable performance over repeated feed injections followed by catalyst regeneration cycles for BODH.|| Piping and instrument diagrams (P&IDs) are a key component of the process industry; they contain information about the plant, including the instruments, lines, valves, and control logic. However, the complexity of these diagrams makes it difficult to extract the information automatically. In this study, we implement an object-detection method to recognize graphical symbols in P&IDs. The framework consists of three parts-region proposal, data annotation, and classification. Sequential image processing is applied as the region proposal step for P&IDs. After getting the proposed regions, the unsupervised learning methods, k-means, and deep adaptive clustering are implemented to decompose the detected dummy symbols and assign negative classes for them. By training a convolutional network, it becomes possible to classify the proposed regions and extract the symbolic information. The results indicate that the proposed framework delivers a superior symbol-recognition performance through dummy detection.|| Global problems such as energy crisis and air pollution issues have motivated researchers to conduct research on water-diesel fuel emulsion as a strategic research works. Researchers agree that water emulsion could reduce emissions of NOx and particulate matters (PM) simultaneously. This paper discusses the parameters that affect the properties and stability of the emulsion, as well as the latest technology in the mixing process of water diesel fuel emulsion. Numerous research activities on different parameters that affect the properties and stability of emulsion have been carried out by many researchers, including the effect of mixing time, temperature, mixing speed, surfactant percentage, and water ratio. In addition to these parameter factors, the mixing technology also play crucial position on the characteristics of the emulsion produced. The size of a water droplet was the character of an emulsion that was strongly influenced by the mixing technology. There were various methods in the mixing process of water emulsion fuels such as ultrasonic vibration, a mechanical homogeniser, mechanical agitators, real-time non-surfactant emulsion fuel system (RTES), rotary high-speed blending machines, stirred high speed, high shear mixers or a combination of several of these methods. In the mixing process, many researchers still use a surfactant as an emulsifier. However, in recent years, surfactants are being minimized and the mixing process has been optimised. In the future, research on emulsion fuel still has excellent prospects, including structured design of experiments, economic studies, engine components, supporting policies for emulsion fuel, and advanced mixing technologies.|| Crystallization occurs in processing i-PP-GnP nanocomposites, and these nanocomposites have the potential to replace traditional fillers and be used to fabricate advanced materials and technology. Therefore, this subject was comprehensively investigated by applying a recent crystallization model, non-isothermal DSC experiments, Raman spectroscopy, and WAXRD. The multi-layer GnP-induced nucleation and the crystal growth rates were modelled. The overall modelling effort generated new insights, results, and explanations. This study confirmed and elucidated, or refuted several published conclusions. It has also been reported that the present model can pursue differences in catalyst-mediated i-PP backbone defects (stereo and regio) by simulating the relative crystallization profile and determining the crystallization kinetic triplet (n, k( o), and E- a). The multiple roles played by GnP were underscored, which exceed what the related literature currently reports. The Raman and XRD work revealed the interaction between GnP and i-PP. The shear-induced dispersion of GnP that occurs during extrusion significantly affected i-PP crystal size distribution. The present approach can also assess the effects of catalyst type and structure, and backbone defect types and their distribution on the non-isothermal crystallization of, in general, polyolefin blends and nanocomposites.|| The reduced amount of pure air entering a cylinder caused by the existence of CNG fuel in the cylinder, causing a decrease in volumetric efficiency on dual fuel engine, which has a negative effect on combustion performances and emissions especially carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon. The injection parameters of CNG fuel include the timing and duration of injection have an important role as the initial control of the injected CNG fuel and the volume of CNG fuel put into the cylinder through the air inlet. Thus, the amount of pure air that enters can be conditioned through these two parameters, in order to obtain the volumetric efficiency and ideal fuel-air mixture so that it can improve combustion performances and emissions on dual fuel engines under low load. This research was conducted on CNG-diesel dual fuel engine by optimizing the timing of CNG injection from 70 degrees to 150 degrees ATDC and the duration of CNG injection from 70 degrees to 150 degrees CA with 20 degrees intervals at low load. The results explained that by retarded the timing of CNG injection (130 degrees ATDC) yielding a value of cylinder pressure and heat release rate (HRR) was the highest with emissions of hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM) were lower and also the amount of CNG volume inserted into the cylinder was more large with optimal CNG injection duration of 110 degrees CA on CNG-diesel dual fuel engine under low load.|| The reactions involved in methanol-to-hydrocarbon (MTH) conversion are complex and simultaneous. In this study, the influence of the temperature and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) was investigated on the MTH kinetic model, which was built on the hydrocarbon pool mechanism using a catalyst of Ca-ZSM-5 (Ca-ZS-5). The existing kinetic model to describe the MTH process is a seven-lump model. The application of any kinetic model for the MTH reaction using the Ca-ZS-5 catalyst has not yet been studied. To obtain high accuracy, new kinetic models were constructed, namely, four- and eight-lump kinetic models. The four-lump model contained oxygenate, olefins, C-5(+) and paraffin. The eight-lump kinetic model included methanol, dimethyl ether, ethylene, propylene, butylene, C-1-C-4 (sum of CH4, C2H6, C3H8 , i-C-4 H-10 , and n-C4H10 ), C-5+ (sum of i-C5H12, n-C5H12, and 1-C-5 H-12), and coke. The MTH experiment was performed at 673-773 K and WHSV values of 4.75, 9.5, and 14.25 h(-1). The model simulation was carried out by fitting the model equation and experimental data to obtain kinetic parameters using MATLAB software. The results indicated that the four- and eight-lump kinetic models can accurately explain the behavior of the reaction kinetics, especially on the effect of the temperature and WHSV.|| In this study, a new magnetic adsorbent, strontium ferrite-bentonite-CoNiAl composite (SF-B-CoNiAl), was synthesized via co-precipitation technique and employed for the adsorptive removal of two anionic dyes, Eriochrome Black T (EBT) and Methyl Orange (MO) from water. The surface functionalities, structure and morphology of the new adsorbent (SF-B-CoNiAl) were evaluated via scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis. The batch experiments indicated that the experimental adsorption capacity of SF-B-CoNiAl was 329.61 and 219.56 mg/g for EBT and MO, respectively. Freundlich isotherm best fitted the experimental data signifying heterogeneous surface with multilayer dyes uptake. The adsorption process of anionic dyes onto SF-B-CoNiAl involves both physisorption and chemisorption. The kinetic data of MO and EBT adsorption by SF-B-CoNiAl were well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The prepared adsorbent exhibited good recyclability that demonstrates their potential for application in water purification.|| Nanofluids have proven their ability to improve the thermal conductivity of base fluids and heat transfer performance in automobiles, heat exchangers, solar collectors and air conditioning systems. However, the stability and optimum operating conditions of nanofluids require further study. Therefore, this study compares the effect of three different types of surfactants; Gum Arabic (GA), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) on the stability and thermo-physical properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/water nanofluids which include: density, viscosity, thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity. Furthermore, the heat transfer characteristics and pressure drop of the optimized nanofluid were investigated using a shell and tube heat exchanger. The stability results demonstrate ratios of (1:0.5) and (1:1) are sufficient to achieve a stable nanofluid for more than 6 months using GA and PVP. Moreover, Mathis TCi thermal conductivity analyzer and differential scanning calorimeter were used to measure thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity of nanofluids. The results demonstrate a significant enhancement of thermal properties, 36% in thermal conductivity and 50% in specific heat capacity using 0.1 wt% of CNT. The experimental results of the heat exchanger demonstrate that the heat transfer rate increases with the concentration of CNT up to 65%, with a maximum corresponding increase in pressure drop of about 15% using 0.5 wt% of CNT. The pumping power calculations indicate that the required power to provide the same amount of heat using nanofluids is one-third of that required for water.

Therefore, the need of clean and sustainable options to meet energy gaps have increased significantly. Gasification and steam methane reforming are the efficient technologies which resourcefully produce the syngas and hydrogen from coal and natural gas, respectively. The syngas and hydrogen can be further utilized to generate power or other Fischer Tropsch chemicals. In this study, two process models are developed and technically compared to analyze the production capacity of syngas and hydrogen. First model is developed based on conventional entrained flow gasification process which is validated with data provided by DOE followed by its integration with the reforming process that leads to the second model. The integrated gasification and reforming process model is developed to maximize the hydrogen production while reducing the overall carbon dioxide emissions. Furthermore, the integrated model eradicates the possibility of reformer's catalyst deactivation due to significant amount of H2S present in the coal derived syngas. It has been seen from results that updated model offers 37% increase in H-2/CO ratio, 10% increase in cold gas efficiency (CGE), 25% increase in overall H2 production, and 13% reduction in CO2 emission per unit amount of hydrogen production compared to base case model. Furthermore, economic analysis indicated 8% reduction in cost for case 2 while presenting 7% enhanced hydrogen contents.|| The continuous demand for olefins has stimulated recent research to develop appropriate technology to produce olefins from alternative resources. Syngas-to-olefins (STO) is considered to be a promising pathway due to the availability of numerous technologies to produce syngas from municipal solid waste and biomass. The development of catalysts to obtain high CO conversion and high selectivity to olefins is still in progress. The first route is based on iron and cobalt catalysts via Fischer Tropsch synthesis to olefins (FTO) with a range of promising supports and promoters. The second approach is based on metal oxide-zeolite (OX-ZEO) composites, with a focus on combined metal oxides to increase the CO conversion. Finally, the potency of less-explored zeolite frameworks such as FER, KFI and Rho zeolites is highlighted. We propose that researchers should focus on FER, KFI and Rho zeolites. However, further reaction mechanism studies should be elaborated to obtain their optimum conditions for STO.|| In this work, a novel integrated gasification system was developed for wet microalgae to produce hydrogen-rich syngas and electricity. The proposed system consists of six major stages: (i) in-situ drying of wet microalgae, (ii) pyrolysis of dried microalgae, (iii) conversion of tar (produced in the pyrolysis stage), (iv) gasification of pyrolysis products, (v) combustion of biochar producing electricity, and (vi) post-treatment of syngas to remove CO2. The proposed gasification was modeled by thermodynamic simulation using Aspen Plus (R). The developed thermodynamic model was first validated against experimental data concerning product composition and yields of the pyrolysis stage under the same operating conditions. Then, performance of the developed system was evaluated for gasification of Porphyra under various operating parameters, including moisture contents, gasifying agent (O-2/steam) flow rates, and biochar distributions between gasification and combustion units. Syngas quality, cold gas efficiency (CGE), and overall energy and exergy efficiencies were considered as the performance metrics. Finally, it was found that under certain operating conditions, moisture content is beneficial to syngas composition, while adverse trends are found for CGE, and overall energy and exergy efficiencies. A proper adjustment of O-2 flow rate can improve both syngas composition and energy performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The prepared oxygen carrier was characterized using SEM-EDS, N-2 adsorption, XRD, TPR and NH3-TPD. The SEM and N-2 adsorption isotherms show excellent dispersion of NiO on the La2O3-Al2O3 indicating the positive effects of La addition on gamma Al2O3 support. The TPR peaks below 600 degrees C confirms the formation of mainly NiO species on La2O3-Al2O3. The NH3-TPD indicated the presence of both weak and strong acid sites on the support. The NH3 desorption kinetics provided information on the type of NH3 desorption including an estimate of the desorption energy. The optimum properties were found on the oxygen carrier with 5 wt% nickel loading, which exhibited the highest oxygen transferability (0.055 g O/g) as well as strong acid sites (105 mu mol NH3/g). Finally, the performance of the oxygen carrier was evaluated in a CREC riser simulator using hexane as a model compound for liquid fuel. The prepared oxygen carrier exhibited an excellent performance, which was reflected by the high CO2 yield (0.70) observed at a temperature of 650 degrees C.|| Municipal solid waste is potentially converted into gaseous fuel through gasification. Tar, the by product, must be reduced to a minimum. In this study, tar was suppressed by applying multi-stage downdraft gasifier with three air inlets in the zone of pyrolysis, oxidation, and reduction in which the whole air for the entire zone was regulated at 21.12 kg/h according to the equivalent ratio (ER) of 0.4. Fixed equivalent ratio was used as a benchmark for single stage numerous air ratios for the three zones were investigated used to obtain optimum performance. The optimum ratio was found to be 10:80:10. LHV and CGE were increased as the increase in CO, H-2 and CH4 concentrations which were triggered by the increase in temperature and the increased rate of the reaction that produces the gas. Char and air oxidation reactions not only occurred in the partial oxidation zone but also occurred in the pyrolysis and reduction zones or the oxidative pyrolysis and heterogeneous oxidation reactions so that the layers of hot zones increased. Tar passed the larger hot zones was favorable for the thermal cracking of tar. Pyrolysis temperature rose of from 449 degrees C to 521 degrees C and energy neutral point has been reached so that changes like endothermic be exothermic. The air in the reduction zone activated the char layer to be more reactive. Improved performance multi-stage air inlet as compared with single stage gasifier can be used as a reference in the optimization of operating parameters for the wider applications of further MSW gasification.|| Commercial BEA zeolite was modified under the radiation of microwave labstation with different modification strategies. Catalytic properties and textural properties were manipulated by desilication using sodium hydroxide or tetrapropyl ammonium hydroxide solution. It was found that sodium hydroxide can lead to very fragile textural properties and low catalytic activity. While tetrapropyl ammonium hydroxide is highly recommended for the improvement of textural properties, especially at long desilication time. Parent and desilicated samples were further modified by octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) in order to add the silane functionality to the zeolitic materials. This addition led to minimizing the textural properties of the silane-treated BEA zeolites and consequentially led to a reduction in the catalytic activity. Recovering and improving the catalytic activity and textural properties were then performed by calcining the silane-treated catalyst to combust the long-chain alkyl groups, which facilitate the formation of silica layer. Another modification strategy was found that the desilicated BEA sample can enhance the catalytic activity and catalytic stability when it treated with a low concentration of nitric acid after desilication. This modification strategy led to improving the catalytic conversion from 29% to 76%.|| Recently, the methanol production has received a lot of attraction in the process industries due to its wide applications in the synthesis of many commercial chemicals and fuels. Most of the coal to methanol processes suffers from higher water consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and lower yields. The aim of this study is to develop a novel energy efficient and economic viable process that may not only increase the methanol production capacity but also offers the less energy requirements with improved process economics. In this study, coal gasification process is sequentially integrated in the parallel design configuration with the natural gas reforming technology to enhance the heating value of the resulting syngas for methanol production. To achieve this aim, two case studies have been developed and compared in terms of overall process performance and economics. Case 1 represents the conventional coal to methanol process, whereas, case 2 represents the conceptual design of integrating the gasification and reforming technologies for enhanced methanol production. The process efficiencies calculated for case 1 and case 2 is 63.2% and 70.0%, respectively. It has been seen from results that the methanol production energy for case 1 and case 2 is 0.69 kg/W and 0.76 kg/W, respectively. In terms of process economics, the methanol production cost for case 1 and case 2 has been estimated as 250 (sic)/tonne and 234 (sic)/tonne, respectively. The comparative analysis showed that the case 2 design not only offers higher process performance but also enhances the process feasibility compared to the conventional coal based processes.

The transient response method with (O)(2) concentration was also utilized to study the oxygen species responsible for dehydrogenation and cracking pathways. Power law models were utilized for the reactions. The activation energies were obtained in the order 34.4 < 68.8 < 88.5 kJ/mol, and pre-exponential factors of 0.857, 1.930, and 0.198 mol/g(cat). min for the first-step dehydrogenation, second-step dehydrogenation, and cracking, respectively, were obtained. The quantitative fixation reveals that the butadiene selectivity mainly reflects the pre-exponential factor as the concentration/accessibility of the active sites.|| An integrated process for gasification of diesel and chemical looping combustion of the gasified syngas for inherent power generation and CO2 capture is developed using Aspen Plus. This system consists of four main units, including (1) gasification of diesel into syngas to ensure complete fuel conversion, (2) chemical looping combustion using an alumina supported nickel-based oxygen carrier, (3) gas turbine-based power generation and (4) steam turbine-based power generation. The model shows a high accuracy (relative error: 2.98%) which is indicated by good agreement of operating temperature, product composition and net power generation between the simulation results and data from the literature. The performance of the integrated system is evaluated based on both energy and exergy analysis approaches. In order to improve the system performance, various split ratio of (diesel) syngas to the CLC unit and to the combustion are investigated. The analysis shows that both the flow rate of oxidation air and the split ratio of syngas to the combustion unit have considerable influences on system performance while the minor effect is found in the pressure ratio. For the overall efficiency, the highest electrical efficiency is 42% and the highest exergy efficiency is 65%.|| In this study, graphene (G) was used as a substrate for NiMgAl ternary-layered hydroxide using coprecipitation technique. The pristine NiMgAl (NMA), graphene-NiMgAl (G/NMA) and their respective calcined products NMA-C and G/NMA-C were investigated as adsorbents for the removal of hazardous eriochrome black T (EBT) dye from an aqueous phase. Characterization results revealed that the incorporation of graphene nanoparticles with NMA with subsequent calcination leads to a significant improvement in surface functionalities, thermal stability, and specific surface area. This resulted in high and fast uptake of EBT molecules from the water phase. The equilibrium time for NMA, NMA-C, G/NMA, and G/NMA-C was achieved at 240 min, 180 min, 90 min, and 60 min, respectively, with optimum pH 4 and dosage of 10 mg. The Langmuir isotherm model describes the adsorption process more appropriately with maximum achievable adsorption capacities of 156.25, 263.16, 238.14, and 384.62 mg/g for NMA, G/NMA, NMA-C, and G/NMA-C, respectively. The kinetic study indicates the adequacy and fitness of the pseudo-second-order model to the experimental data for all four adsorbents. The thermodynamic evaluation substantiates the exothermic nature of the adsorption processes. The mechanism of EBT-G/NMA-C adsorption system involved surface adsorption, electrostatic, strong chemical, and ion exchange interactions along with surface reconstruction. Integration of graphene with subsequent calcination substantially improved the surface and structure characteristics of NMA which facilitated enhanced adsorption performance with sorption rate and excellent reusability performance, confirming it as a highly promising adsorbent for the efficient remediation of dye-contaminated wastewater.|| This article discusses the effect of microwave irradiation on the thermal properties of poly(vinyl alcohol)/graphene nanocomposites, prepared using a solution casting technique. Samples were subjected to microwave radiation for 5, 10 and 15 min at a constant power of 200 watts. The crystallinity and thermal stability of the irradiated samples were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis. Reduction in crystallinity and thermal stability of PVA was observed with incorporation of graphene due to restricted dynamic movement of chains and synergistic instability, respectively. Microwave irradiation for 5 min improved the crystallinity and thermal stability of the nanocomposites. However, further irradiation caused a decrease in the crystallinity as well as in the thermal stability due to degradation. Moreover, the isothermal crystallization kinetics were studied by DSC. An increase in the crystallization rate was observed with graphene incorporation.|| Microalgae are a sustainable raw material for biodiesel production that earned a lot of consideration. Biodiesel from the conventional transesterification (liquid acid based) process of microalgae oil needs pre-treatment before its use as fuel. Moreover, the oil extraction process is energy extensive. In this study, room temperature assisted in situ transesterification method is reported using a solid acid catalyst obtained from sulfonated rice husk (RHS). The RHS catalyst was synthesized by microwave acid treatment of rice husk. The surface characterization of RHS by XRD, FT-IR, Raman, and XPS confirms the presence of -SO3H, while the pore anatomy and pore structure analysis by FE-SEM and BET substantiate the presence of porous structure and high surface area. Furthermore, the RHS catalyst was successfully employed for the in situ transesterification of the microalgae (Parachlorella kessleri) biomass. Various experimental conditions influencing the in situ transesterification were evaluated. The optimization of catalyst dose revealed that 30 mg RHS produce highest FAME yield after 30-min reaction time at room temperature (25 degrees C). Performance of the catalyst was compared with rice husk-derived fluorocarbon (RHFC) and conventional acid catalyst (H2SO4). Moreover, in the proposed approach, there is no need for oil extraction step and pre-treatment of biodiesel after the reaction. RHS is very effective at room temperature compared with conventional transesterification.|| A dual-loop organic Rankine cycle (D-ORC) was used to recover waste heat from a biomass gasification process, for combined heat, hydrogen, and power (CHHP) generation. The process is based on the integration of biomass gasification with catalytic partial oxidation (CPO) and water-gas shift catalytic membrane reactors (WGS CMRs) for the simultaneous production and separation of hydrogen. The high temperature loop of the ORC was used to cool the CPO reactor effluent, while the low temperature loop was used to cool the WGS CMR retentate. Energy and exergy analyses were carried out to select the optima working fluids for this application. Hydrocarbons, siloxanes, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs) were examined as potential candidates in this analysis. Results indicate that the highest efficiency was obtained when n-heptane and n-pentane were used as working fluids for the high and low temperature loops, respectively. Using this combination, electric and exergy efficiencies of 13.93% and 36.41% were computed, receptively. The process generates 1.37 kW of power, and produces 1.41 kg/hr of hydrogen at 773 K and 91.32 kg/hr of hot water at 363 K. The exergy analysis has also showed that the high temperature loop turbine and condenser have contributed the most, by around 32%, to the overall system irreversibility.|| Removal of dyes from wastewater is one of the major concerns of the modem age. Dendrimers and their composites are emerging as effective materials for an array of applications due to their unique fractal architecture and peculiar characteristics. Herein, we aim to provide a critical review of the application of dendrimer complexes for adsorptive removal and catalytic degradation of dyes. Thoughtful attempt was made to elucidate the relationship of vital process parameters, composition of hybrids, and generation growth of dendrimers with dye-removal performance. This article provides performance evaluation, effects of process parameters, and mechanism for the eradication of dyes through dendrimer assisted adsorption and catalysis in light of key results reported in current literature.

We implement multigene genetic programming (MGGP) to investigate the solid holdup and distribution in three LSCFB systems with different heights. In addition to data obtained here, we also use a portion of data sets of LSCFB systems developed by Zheng (1999) and Liang et al. (1996). Model predictions are in good agreement with the experimental data in both radial and axial directions and at different normalized superficial liquid and solid velocities. The radial profiles of the solid holdup are approximately identical at a fixed average cross-sectional solid holdup for the three LSCFB systems studied. Statistical performance indicators including the mean absolute percentage error (6.19%) and correlation coefficient (0.985) are within an acceptable range. The results suggest that a MGGP modeling approach is suitable for predicting the solid holdup and distribution of a scaled-up LSCFB system.

The supports, with different SrO/gamma Al2O3 ratios, were synthesized by a surfactant-free method, while VOx was incorporated on SrO-gamma Al2O3 by impregnation. NH3-TPD showed that the acidity of the catalysts decreased with the increase of SrO. The incorporation of SrO also modified the reducibility (H-2-TPR) of the catalysts. VOx appeared as amorphous polymeric species on the support, confirmed by XRD, Raman and FTIR analyses.

9,Phys Department,Sciences,103,365,33,44,24,32.67,43.56,23.76,80.58,12.62,6.8,83,13,7,"|| A visible-light-active nickel oxide-graphitic carbon nitride (NiO@g-CN) hetero-structured nanocomposite was synthesized for the first time by pulsed laser ablation in liquid and used as a photoanode material in photoelectrochemical water-splitting reaction with a solar simulator. It was found that the photoelectrochemical performance of PLAL synthesized NiO@g-CN nanocomposite as photoanode, compared to g-CN as photoanode showed fourfold enhancements in photocurrent density under visible light. FT-IR, XRD, FE-SEM, and EDX consistently showed the proper anchoring of nano-sized NiO on g-CN. UV-DRS and the band gap estimation showed the narrowing down of the band gap energy and consequent enhancement in the visible-light absorption, whereas photoluminescence spectroscopy confirmed the reduction of the recombination of photo-excited electron hole pairs as a result of the anchoring of NiO on g-CN. The photoelectrochemical performance of g-CN and the NiO@g-CN nanocomposite photoanodes was compared by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), Chronoamperometry (I-t), and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). All of these results of the characterization studies account for the observed fourfold enhancement of photocurrent density of NiO@g-CN nanocomposite as photoanode in the photoelectrochemical reaction.|| The aim of the reported study is to enhance the photovoltaic performance of a dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) using co-sensitization approach and investigate how the concentration of an organic co-sensitizer influence the overall efficiency of the fabricated DSSCs. The overall efficiency of the fabricated DSSC with co-sensitization approach using a ruthenium (II) based dye, N749, and an organic sensitizer, RK1, is 8.15%. The solar cells were evaluated using UV-Vis spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE), and current-voltage (I-V) characteristics. The concentration of the organic co-sensitizer has a strong effect on the performance of the DSSC. An optimized solar cell fabricated with a dye solution of 0.2 mM RK1 and 0.3 mM N749 yielded a J(sc )(mA/cm(2)) = 19.45, V-oc (mV) = 688, FF (%) = 61 and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of eta(%) = 8.15 under standard (AM1.5 G) 1 sun illumination (100 mW/cm(2)). The efficiency of co-sensitized DSSCs is far better than the efficiency of fabricated solar cells sensitized with individual dyes [N749 (eta = 4.94%) and RK1 (eta = 5.76%)]. The efficiency enhancement is due to the lower rate of recombination of electrons and holes, decreased I-/I-3(-) competitive absorption, and lower aggregation of the dyes resulting from the synergistic action in the co-sensitized photovoltaic cells.|| Certain types of cancer deaths are widespread due to the diagnostic complexities at the early stages. Recent studies revealed that the bio-accumulated heavy metals (act as pro -carcinogens) in the human colon cause strong interactions with the nuclear proteins, leading to the DNA damages and repair processes inhibition, resulting in the cancers. Most of the conventional detection techniques suffer from the insensitiveness, cost-intensiveness, imprecision, slowness, cumbersomeness of sample preparation, and conflicting outcomes. To surmount these shortcomings an accurate, reliable, and rapid detection technique is essential for the early diagnostic and prevention of heavy metals accumulation induced colon cancers. This will enable not only to classify the malignant and non-malignant cells but can differentiate the proteins from abnormal cellular morphology. Using the indigenously developed fast and accurate (calibration-free) laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), we analyzed several cancerous and normal colon tissues collected from the colon cancer infected patients aged 40-60 years. The results showed the presence of carcinogenic heavy metals including lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), and mercury (Hg) in the malignant colon tissues, while the healthy tissues were devoid of these elements. The concentrations of Pb, Cr and Hg in the cancerous samples were discerned to be 3.1, 13.4 and 7.1 tig/L, respectively. Furthermore, the performance accuracy of the LIBS technique was validated by comparing the results obtained from the standard inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). It was established that the LIBS analysis is useful for the speedy, precise and early detection of the heavy metals amassed malignant colon tissues, thereby saving millions of lives by promoting the chances for cancer cure.

Many attempts on the modification of perovskite materials through introduction of dopants have resulted in an alteration of their chemical structure. Herein, we present a clean and structure-preserving technique for tuning the optical and crystallographic properties of bismuth-based lead-free perovskite materials through irradiation with 2.5 mJ laser pulses ejected from a Nd:YAG laser operating in its second harmonics. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra show improved crystallinity and reduced crystallite size, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show a defect-minimized surface morphology, photoluminescence (PL) spectra show a minimized rate of Auger recombination, and absorbance spectra show improved absorbance at a constant band gap value. Consequently, simplified sandwiched-architecture-type photodetectors fabricated with the modified bismuth-based perovskite materials display a maximum photodetectivity of 4.5 X 10(9) Jones, maximum photoresponsivity of 25 mu A/W, maximum photosensitivity of about 10(4), and minimum optical switching time of 10 ms under testing conditions of -2 V bias voltage, 15 mW/cm(2) incident solar light, and room temperature. Thus, laser pulse irradiation represents an alternative method for enhancing the optical and crystallographic properties of perovskite materials from which highly efficient classes of photonic and photovoltaic devices can be developed.|| Carbon-based nanomaterials have attracted a lot of interest lately due to their highly promising applications. Here we report on the modifications of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) induced by swift (highly energetic) heavy ions. Using scanning force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy, we observe a dramatic change in the structure of the irradiated SWCNTs, accompanied by an increase of the adhesion force as a function of ion fluence and electronic energy loss. With increasing ion fluence, the SWCNTs exhibit a partial transformation from metallic to more semiconducting. Moreover, at high fluence they break into segments 10-20 nm long.|| Thermoelectric (TE) materials have increasingly entranced the attention of researchers globally, with a view to providing alternative routes to clean energy. This work reports the first thermal conductivity measurement on pulsed laser deposited Bi2Se2.7Te0.3 (BTS) thin films by a non-contact and optical-based method. Structural characterization revealed well-crystalline films whereas the scanning electron microscope images show abundant grains typical of the BTS nanostructures. A highly stoichiometric composition was observed under energy dispersive spectroscopy. The film's first-order temperature coefficient was estimated by varying the substrate temperature using advanced Raman spectrometer equipped with an inbuilt Linkam stage. The linear dependence of the E-2(g) phonon mode on temperature and excitation laser power was harnessed to estimate the value of the suspended film's room temperature thermal conductivity. The first-order temperature coefficient was measured to be 0.0359 cm(-1) K-1. The low thermal conductivity measured at room temperature (kappa similar to 1.12 Wm(-1)K(-1)) is comparable to previously reported values obtained using different conventional techniques. This work proved the potential of Raman spectroscopy to estimate the thermal conductivity as an excellent alternative tool to the existing expensive and laborious techniques. In addition, this work demonstrated that BTS is an excellent material for thermoelectric energy harvesting.|| The chemisorption of CO and CO2 on zinc oxide triangular nanowires, doped with Al and Cu atoms, was studied using density functional calculations. Adsorption energies for CO on doped nanowires are higher than those for the pristine nanowire. In particular, configurations forming C-Al bonds have double the adsorption energies when compared to those in the pristine nanowire. A lower adsorption energy is found when both the CO atoms are bonded to the Al-doped ZnO nanowire. For the Cu-doped nanowire, double-bond configurations have the highest adsorption energies. CO2 forms tri-dentate structures in the pristine nanowires. In Al-doped nanowires, we observed mono- and bi-dentate modes of adsorption, and only one configuration showed enhancement in the adsorption energy. The CO2 prefers to bond to a Zn atom in the Cu-doped nanowire. Reductions in the band gap energy and shifts in the stretching frequency due to adsorption are also discussed.|| Modulation spectroscopy is a well-established method for the study of optical transitions in semiconductors and has been a valuable asset for the verification of theoretical band structure calculations. The most important aspect of this method is its ability to render clear spectral features with no prior assumptions. One modulation technique is electroabsorption, in which the transmittance of a sample is modulated by the application of a time-varying electric field while light is incident on the sample. In this work, a modified form of electroabsorption was investigated in which the electric field was applied at the interface between the sample and a transparent conducting layer. This technique was applied to investigate the optical transitions in tungsten trioxide (WO3). The resultant spectral features were distinctly localized in energy. Analysis of the experimental spectra was carried out using Aspnes' third derivative model, and the results were interpreted in terms of theoretical calculations.|| We have studied the effect of post growth annealing in oxygen ambient on the optical, chemical and electronic properties of zinc nitride thin films. The films were prepared by reactive radio frequency magnetron sputtering of zinc target in the presence of argon and nitrogen gasses at a substrate temperature of 300 degrees C. Post growth annealing was performed at annealing temperatures of 300, 400, 500, 600, and 700 degrees C in the oxygen environment to transform the zinc nitride films into p-type zinc oxide. Atomic force microscopy of the films reveal that surface roughness and grain size of the films are directly proportional to the post-growth annealing temperature. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of the films revealed that as-grown film has the highest intensity of nitrogen in the film whereas little nitrogen remains in the films that were annealed at 500 degrees C and higher temperatures. Films annealed at higher temperatures have lower carrier concentration but higher Hall mobility compared to the as-grown film and the films annealed at lower temperature. Moreover, as-grown film and the films annealed at lower temperature have n-type conductivity whereas films annealed at temperatures above 500 degrees C exhibit p-type conductivity. Films annealed at lower temperature have bandgap values closer to the zinc oxynitride but bandgap of the films annealed at higher temperatures have values close to the bandgap of zinc oxide. This indicates that post growth annealing of zinc nitride films at 500 degrees C in oxygen ambient transforms it into p-type zinc oxide.|| The broadening of the oxygen absorption line P9P9 due to wall collisions of entrapped oxygen gas in nanoporous solid discs of average pore diameters between 70 and 150 nm is studied using GAs in Scattering Media Absorption Spectroscopy (GASMAS) method. A model based on the kinetic theory of gasses is used to find a correlation between the wall-collision broadening and the average pore diameter measured by Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP). The shape of the pores of investigated samples is found to be more consistent with a model of pores of cylindrical shapes of heights much larger than their diameters.|| Cadmium sulfide-graphitic carbon nitride nanocomposite was synthesized by pulsed laser ablation in liquid, and it was found from the results of optical and morphological characterizations that the proper anchoring of nanostructured cadmium sulfide on the nano-sheets of graphitic carbon nitride took place, which brought about the positive attributes such as enhanced visible light absorption and reduced photo-generated charge recombination, the key features required for an efficient photo-catalyst by solar light harvesting. The pulsed laser ablation in liquid method adopted for the synthesis of cadmium sulfide-graphitic carbon nitride has the following advantages: the shape and size of the synthesized particles can be controlled by altering the experimental parameters such as laser wavelength, pulse laser duration, the pH of the solution, the surfactants and the temperature of the solution, pulsed laser ablation in liquid method neither requires cumbersome equipment nor does it require intermediate chemicals and catalysts nor does it necessitate the post synthesis purification. The enhancement of photo-catalytic activity of cadmium sulfide-graphitic carbon nitride nanocomposite was tested for the photo-catalytic deactivation of Escherichia colt bacteria in water under visible light radiation. As anticipated, a significant improvement of photo-catalytic deactivation was observed, which is attributed to the enhanced and extended light absorption in the visible spectral region, and the formation of herterojunction between the semiconductors, which is instrumental in inhibiting the undesired recombination of photo-generated charge carriers. Quantitatively, the presence of cadmium sulfide on the graphitic carbon nitride surface contributed to a remarkable 129% increase of photo-catalytic degradation constant compared to pure graphitic carbon nitride, which resulted in the decrease of total depletion time of Escherichia colt from 156 min to 67 min with the cadmium sulfide-graphitic carbon nitride nanocomposite synthesized by pulsed laser ablation in liquid method. Our results on the efficient photo-catalytic deactivation of Escherichia colt under visible light assures that cadmium sulfide-graphitic carbon nitride nanocomposite can very well be used for photo-catalytic water purification by harvesting the abundant solar light.|| Long-term natural and anthropogenic aerosol characteristics over the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are investigated in this study. Aerosol characteristics were analyzed using data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), local meteorological stations, and the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) ground-based station during 2006-2015. AOD values significantly increase during the spring and summer seasons and are associated with dust loading during major dust events. The mean annual variation of aerosol loading indicates about a 4.32 and a 11.36% change in the AOD and Angstrom Exponent (AE), respectively, during the study period. Monthly trends show larger AOD and AE variability, 5.4 and 37.8% respectively, with higher aerosol concentrations during the summer. In general, from November to March an upward trend in aerosol characteristics is observed from 2011 to 2015 compared to 2006-2010. In contrast, a neutral to weak decrease in AOD measurements are observed during April-September. Overall, this trend variability is sustained by natural aerosol emissions throughout the year. Meanwhile, a significant increase in AE was measured from May to August of 2011-2015 compared to 2006-2010. This is an indication of an increment of anthropogenic emissions from 2011 to 2015. A correlation between several meteorological parameters (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction) and MODIS measurements was performed to investigate the effect of local meteorological conditions on AOD from 2006 to 2015 over the UAE. Some statistical correlation was observed between AOD, wind speed, and air temperature. A weak correlation was observed between temperature, relative humidity, and AOD, while a strong correlation was observed between wind speed and AOD. Dry soil formed due to a lack of rainfall, along with high summer temperatures and high-speed winds which stimulate dust aerosol loading and lifetime in the atmosphere. Aerosol characteristics, including dominant aerosols, were identified over the UAE using the Mezaria AERONET station. Air mass flow towards the UAE from the North West (NW) and West (W) directions moves over highly polluted regions and desert areas. Coarse-mode aerosol particles dominate over the UAE during March-June associated with the dust season, while a high loading of fine-mode particles is mostly observed during September-January.|| Polymeric-inorganic graphitic carbon nitride-cadmium sulfide (g-C3N4-CdS) nanocomposites, with different mass ratios of CdS (5 %,10 %, 20 % and 30 %) anchored in g-C3N4 network were synthesized for the first time by laser ablation technique, using a nanosecond pulsed laser of 532 nm wavelength in water medium. The synthesized g-C3N4-CdS nanocomposites were used as a catalyst in the process of photo-catalytic degrading toxic cationic and anionic dyes in aqueous solutions under visible light irradiation. Our results revealed that g-C3N4-CdS nanocomposites, in general showed better photo-catalytic efficiency than that shown by pure g-C3N4, particularly, the nanocomposite with 20 % CdS in g-C3N4-CdS yielded the highest efficiency in the photo-catalytic degradation of both the dyes under study. The enhanced photo-catalytic degradation efficiency of g-C3N4-CdS nanocomposites, in general is mainly due to the enhanced visible light absorption brought about by the anchoring of CdS on the g-C3N4 network, and also due to the reduced photo-generated charge recombination mediated by the formation of heterojunction between the two semiconducting composite partners, which are quite evident respectively from the recorded UV-DRS and PL spectra of g-C3N4-CdS nanocomposites. Besides optical characterizations, structural, elemental and morphological characterizations, using XRD, FE-SEM, TEM, HR-TEM, XPS and FT-IR were carried out and the results of this work is elucidated in the light of the characterization studies.|| High-resolution spectral analysis of a multimode GaN-based blue laser diode was performed as a function of temperature and current both below and above the threshold levels. Maps of longitudinal modes evolution as a function of current and temperature were obtained from the highly resolved emission spectra of the laser diode. The evolution of emitted longitudinal modes with current and temperature exhibited redshifts at rates of 0.0059 nm/mA and 0.0149 nm/degrees C, respectively. Similarly, the laser gain profile was observed to shift towards longer wavelengths but with rates of 0.022 nm/mA and 0.0439 nm/degrees C. The longitudinal mode spacing of 0.0540 nm was experimentally evaluated and compared with its equivalent theoretically predicted value.|| Carbon honeycomb has a nanoporous structure with good mechanical properties including strength. Here we investigate the adsorption and diffusion of hydrogen in carbon honeycomb via grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations and molecular dynamics simulations including strength. Based on the adsorption simulations, molecular dynamics simulations are employed to study the effect of pressure and temperature for the adsorption and diffusion of hydrogen. To study the effect of pressure, we select the 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 bars. Meanwhile, we have studied the hydrogen storage capacities of the carbon honeycomb at 77 K, 153 K, 193 K, 253 K and 298 K. A high hydrogen adsorption of 4.36 wt.% is achieved at 77 K and 20 bars. The excellent mechanical properties of carbon honeycomb and its unique three-dimensional honeycomb microporous structure provide a strong guarantee for its application in practical engineering fields.|| Here, we investigate effects of the size of pores in porous alumina powders on the broadening of the oxygen gas absorption line. The line broadening is caused by collisions of oxygen molecules with the pore walls and is extracted using gas in scattering media absorption spectroscopy (GASMAS), while the average pore size is determined using the gas adsorption technique. The average pore size of the samples studied lies within the range 10-40 nm. In this range, the contribution of the wall collision broadening is found to be approximately inversely related to the average pore diameter. Furthermore, the confined oxygen gas absorbance measured by GASMAS is found to be linearly correlated with the effective porosity evaluated by the saturation method. (C) 2020 Optical Society of America|| Transparent conducting oxides are materials characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of high optical transparency and electrical conductivity. Among them, tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) has been established as the best material with these criteria. This work focused on the enhancement of the electrical conductivity of ITO thin films through reactive DC sputtering under a hydrogen plasma. The films were deposited on heated substrates (350 degrees C) with the hydrogen concentration varying from 0 to 20% of the flow rate of argon. The structural properties (crystalline orientation and surface roughness) varied as functions of the hydrogen concentration. The electrical resistivity reached a minimum value of 2.0 x 10(-4) omega cm for a hydrogen concentration of 15%, corresponding to a reduction by a factor of 4 compared to the films deposited without hydrogen. The optical band gap of the films was 4 eV, and was not affected by the hydrogen concentration. The average visible transmittance decreased as the hydrogen concentration increased but maintained a value above 80%. The infrared reflectance increased upon hydrogenation, shifting the plasmon frequency into the near-infrared spectral range.|| The application of membranes for environmental applications is becoming increasingly popular with researchers and scientists. This work reports the surface modification of membranes by a facile technique and its subsequent use for efficient separation of different types of oils from water. Stainless steel membranes were dip-coated with different concentrations of a low surface energy silane, perfluorooctyltrichlorosilane. The bonding between the silane film and substrate were confirmed by the use of spectroscopic techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Scanning electron microscopic images showed the coatings to be continuous and uniform, an observation that was corroborated by the presence of almost spherical water droplets on different regions of the coated membrane. Contact angle measurements with representative oils and water revealed the superoleophilic (CA similar to 0 degrees) and superhydrophobic (CA similar to 150.5 degrees) character of the modified membrane after seven immersion cycles in the silane. The coated membrane was able to separate different types of oils from water with a high efficiency (>95 %) that was maintained after repeated passage. The separation mechanism was explained by a theoretical model that takes into account interfacial tension and pressure-driven forces. The usefulness of the coated membrane for large-scale applications was demonstrated by the high values of oil fluxes and the large intrusion pressures determined experimentally.

These structures consist of a metal/dielectric bi-layer, in which the metal is silver and the dielectric is a wide-bandgap semiconductor with a high refractive index. These layers are typically very thin (< 30 nm), and thus may be etched away if deposited by a sputtering process. This work has two objectives. First, a new design is fabricated that can sustain the sputtering process. Second, a high-refractive-index material (i.e., bismuth oxide) is selected to serve as the dielectric. Bismuth oxide is deposited by reactive direct-current sputtering, and the deposition parameters are optimized to yield films that are suitable for use in spectrally selective coatings. When used in a silver-based multilayer structure, the resulting peak visible transmittance was 68%, and the maximum infrared reflectance was 85%.

These unique materials possess great ionic response. Hence, their suitability for energy storage device applications needs to be explored. We fabricated for the first time all-solid-state perovskite electrochemical supercapacitors with high areal capacitance, fast charge-discharge rate, high power density and superior cyclability. We investigated electrochemical energy storage performance of two different quasi-solid-state electrolytes sandwiched between two symmetric perovskite electrodes. We recorded highest areal capacitance of 21.50 mu F/cm(2) which is 3.65 times greater than areal capacitance recorded by similar perovskite electrochemical capacitors utilizing liquid-state electrolytes. High power density of 5.05 W/cm(2) was achieved. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to study the ionic transport mechanism and properties of our fabricated devices. The Nyquist plots exhibit linear characteristic across low and high frequency ranges, indicating excellent electrolytes diffusion into the perovskite electrodes and confirming ideal supercapacitor behavior of these devices. All devices exhibit short relaxation time with device having least relaxation time of 251.19 mu s indicative of fast discharge properties of fabricated devices. Our devices show excellent cyclability with device retaining 98.34% of its initial capacitance after 1000 cycles. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Each method successfully produced crystalline material with enhancement in photophysical and photocatalytic properties. The origin of the enhanced photophysical was investigated with electron paramagnetic resonance and ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy measurements. The observed decrease in the electronic band gaps of the modified UiO-66-based MOFs is supported by density functional theory (DFT)-electronic structure calculations. The DFT-simulations also confirmed the synergistic effect between -NH2 functionalization and titanium metal incorporation that boosts the reactivity of the respective resulting MOFs. A detailed investigation of CO2 reduction was then carried out with the different MOFs models. A remarkable enhancement of the photocatalytic activity was observed by using the UiO-66-NH2 based frameworks compared to the pristine UiO-66. A nearly doubled photocatalytic activity was obtained by the Ti-Zr mixed MOF materials regardless of the method or the ratio of incorporated titanium metal loading.|| The polyaniline/graphene (PANi/GR) composites were prepared by the in-situ polymerization technique for the counter electrode of a dye-sensitized solar cell. Adding graphene in the polyaniline matrix reduces the charge transfer resistance at the counter-electrode and thus improves the photovoltaic performance of devices. In this work, graphene contents were varied from 6% to 15%. The morphology and the crystallographic structure of PANi/GR composites were examined by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The stability and electrochemical activity were investigated by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometery. The results indicated that the electrochemical and photovoltaic performances of dye-sensitized solar cells were affected by the graphene contents in composites. The solar cell constructed by PANi/9%GR composite counter-electrode indicated the overall efficiency of 7.45% and the interface resistance (R-ct) between electrolyte and counter-electrode is 20.1 Omega. This performance was slightly lower than platinum-based solar cells (PCE = 7.63% and R-ct = 19.2 Omega) fabricated under similar conditions.|| Graphyne was recently facilely synthesized with superior mechanical and electrical performance. We investigate the ballistic protection properties of alpha-, beta-, delta-, and gamma-graphyne sheets using molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with elastic theory. The velocities of the in-plane elastic wave and out-of-plane cone wave are obtained by both membrane theory and molecular dynamics simulations. The specific penetration energies are approximately 83% that of graphene, indicating high impact resistance. gamma-Graphyne has high sound wave speeds comparable to those of graphene, and its Young's modulus is approximately 60% that of graphene. delta-Graphyne has the highest cone wave speed among the four structures, while alpha-graphyne possesses the highest penetration energy and impact resistance at most tested projectile speeds. Our results indicate that graphyne is a good protective structural material.|| Lattice constant mismatch between materials affects the quality of thin film fabrication. For this reason, lattice constants information is vital in the design of materials for technological applications. The determination of lattice constants via experimental analysis is relatively expensive and laborious. As a result, several linear empirical models have been proposed to predict the lattice constant of crystal structures. However, the accuracies of these models are limited partly due to their failure to account for nonlinearity in the atomic parameters-lattice constant relationship. Machine learning techniques have shown excellent ability to deal with nonlinear problems in many areas of materials science; hence, they are considered suitable computation tools to study the crystal structure of materials. In this contribution, we developed a support vector regression (SVR) model to predict the lattice constant of cubic crystals of the form A(2)XY(6) (A = K, Cs, Rb, TI; X = tetravalent cation; and Y = F, Cl, Br, I). The SVR algorithm uses the ionic radii and electronegativities data of the constituent elements of A(2)XY(6) cubic crystals as model inputs. The robustness of the proposed model was demonstrated by comparing our result with an existing linear model based on 26 cubic crystal samples. The result revealed a total relative deviation of 1.757 and 2.704 for the SVR model and the existing linear equation, respectively. This result proves that the SVR model has a huge potential in the search for new materials for different applications.

This theory includes indeterminate integral variables and contains only four unknowns in which any shear correction factor not used, with even less than the conventional theory of first shear strain (FSDT). Applying the principle of virtual displacements, the governing equations and boundary conditions are obtained. To solve the buckling problem for different boundary conditions, Galerkin's approach is utilized for symmetric EGM sandwich plates with six different boundary conditions. A detailed numerical study is carried out to examine the influence of plate aspect ratio, elastic foundation coefficients, ratio, side-to-thickness ratio and boundary conditions on the buckling response of FGM sandwich plates. A good agreement between the results obtained and the available solutions of existing shear deformation theories that have a greater number of unknowns proves to demonstrate the precision of the proposed theory.|| This paper, presents the dynamic and stability analysis of the simply supported single walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWCNT) reinforced concrete beam on elastic-foundation using an integral first-order shear deformation beam theory. The condition of the zero shear-stress on the free surfaces of the beam is ensured by the introduction of the shear correction factors. The SWCNT reinforcement is considered to be uniform and variable according to the X , O and V forms through the thickness of the concrete beam. The effective properties of the reinforced concrete beam are calculated by employing the rule of mixture. The analytical solutions of the buckling and free vibrational behaviors are derived via Hamilton's principle and Navier method. The analytical results of the critical buckling loads and frequency parameters of the SWCNT-RC beam are presented in the form of explicit tables and graphs. Also the diverse parameters influencing the dynamic and stability behaviors of the reinforced concrete beam are discussed in detail.|| There is an increasing tendency to use recycled aggregate to produce concrete due to diminishing sources of natural aggregate. The properties of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) are inferior to that of normal aggregate concrete. Several strategies including the use of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) are adopted to improve the properties of RAC. The two-stage mixing approach (TSMA) is also used as an improvement strategy. The present study was aimed to examine the individual and combined effects of using SCMs and TSMA on the fresh and hardened properties of RAC. Three SCMs, namely, fly ash, ground granulated blast furnace slag, and silica fume were used with and without TSMA. The experimental data indicated the beneficial effect of SCMs and TSMA on workability, strength, shrinkage, and durability of RAC. Further, the cost per unit strength of the RAC with SCMs and TSMA was less than that of RAC without any treatment. The use of developed RAC will lead to technical, economic, and environmental benefits.|| One of several methods used to minimize reinforcement corrosion is the use of service-life prediction models to calculate mixture design and construction variables for the desired service life of a structure. Although several models are available for this purpose, very few incorporate the effect of environmental temperature on chloride diffusion. Moreover, most of the earlier studies were conducted under laboratory conditions and they are not based on actualfield data. In the reported study, chloride diffusion in Type V and silica fume cement concretes was evaluated under laboratory and field conditions. Large-size concrete specimens were exposed in the tidal zone ofa marine exposure site fbr 1, 2, 5, and 10 years while the laboratory specimens were exposed to a chloride solution maintained at 22, 35, 50, and 60 degrees C (71.6, 95, 122, and 140 degrees F) for 1 year The coefficient of chloride diffusion (D-a) for Type V cement concrete specimens placed in the field was noted to be much more than that ofsilica fiane cement concrete specimens at all exposure periods. However; the D-a for both type V and silica fume cement concrete specimens decreased by 1.3 to 3 times with increasing period of exposure. The D-a for the laboratory concrete specimens increased by 2.2 to 3.8 times as the exposure temperature was increased from 22 to 60 degrees C (71.6 to 140 degrees F). Furthermore, the D-a for Type vcemen t concrete specimens was 2.9 to 5 times more than that of silica Arne cement concrete specimens. Empirical models correlating the field and laboratory data were developed. These models could be useful for calculating the D-a for field conditions from the laboratory data.|| Analysis of travel mode choice is vital in policymaking and transportation planning to comprehend and forecast travel demands. Universities resemble major trip attraction hubs, with many students and faculty members living on campus or nearby. This study aims to investigate the effects of socioeconomic characteristics on the travel mode choice of university students. A nested ensemble approach with artificial neural networks (ANNs) was used to model the mode choice behavior. It was found that students generally prefer motorized modes (bus and car). A more detailed analysis revealed that teenage students (aged 17-19 years) had an approximately equal probability of selecting motorized and non-motorized modes. Graduate students revealed a higher tendency to select motorized modes compared with other students. The findings of this study demonstrate the need to promote non-motorized modes of transport among students, which is possible by providing favorable infrastructure for these modes.|| In this research work, the hygrothermal and mechanical buckling responses of simply supported FG sandwich plate seated on Winkler-Pasternak elastic foundation are investigated using a novel shear deformation theory. The current model take into consideration the shear deformation effects and ensures the zero shear stresses on the free surfaces of the FG-sandwich plate without requiring the correction factors ""Ks"". The material properties of the faces sheets of the FG-sandwich plate are assumed varies as power law function ""P-FGM"" and the core is isotropic (purely ceramic). From the virtual work principle, the stability equations are deduced and resolved via Navier model. The hygrothermal effects are considered varies as a nonlinear, linear and uniform distribution across the thickness of the FG-sandwich plate. To check and confirm the accuracy of the current model, a several comparison has been made with other models found in the literature. The effects the temperature, moisture concentration, parameters of elastic foundation, side-to-thickness ratio, aspect ratio and the inhomogeneity parameter on the critical buckling of FG sandwich plates are also investigated.|| This article deals with the flexural analysis of anti-symmetric cross-ply laminated plates under nonlinear thermal loading using a refined plate theory with four variables. In this theory, the undetermined integral terms are used and the number of variables is reduced to four, instead of five or more in other higher-order theories. The boundary conditions on the top and the bottom surfaces of the plate are satisfied; hence the use of the transverse shear correction factors is avoided. The principle of virtual work is used to obtain governing equations and boundary conditions. Navier solution for simply supported plates is used to derive analytical solutions. For the validation of the present theory, numerical results for displacements and stresses are compared with those of classical, first-order, higher-order and trigonometric shear theories reported in the literature.|| In this study, a simple two-dimensional shear deformation model is employed for buckling analysis of functionally graded (FG) plates. The proposed theory has a kinematic with integral terms which considers the influence of shear deformation without using ""shear correction factors"". The impact of varying material properties and volume fraction of the constituent on buckling response of the FG plate is examined and discussed. The benefit of this theory over other contributions is that a number of variables is reduced. The basic equations that consider the influence of transverse shear stresses are derived from the principle of virtual displacements. The analytical solutions are obtained utilizing the ""Navier method"". The accuracy of the proposed theory is proved by comparisons with the different solutions found in the literature.|| The performance of fiber reinforced polymer externally bonded to concrete is greatly influenced by the environmental conditions to which it is exposed during service. Temperature and humidity are the two common environmental factors that alter the bond behavior of externally bonded fiber reinforced polymer. This paper reviews the experimental and computational approaches used to evaluate the hygrothermal effects-that is, the effect of temperature and humidity-on the durability of the fiber reinforced polymer-concrete bond, as well as on the bond's performance under loading conditions. Some experimental testing conducted in the laboratory and in situ are critically reviewed and presented. Implemented approaches for improving bond performance under hygrothermal conditions and their modeling techniques are also presented. The paper concludes by discussing the review's salient issues. The ongoing wide application of externally bonded fiber reinforced polymer creates opportunities for new research on improving and predicting the bond strength of fiber reinforced polymer concrete under hygrothermal conditions.|| In the present work, the buckling behavior of a single-layered graphene sheet (SLGS) embedded in visco-Pastemak's medium is studied using nonlocal four-unknown integral model. This model has a displacement field with integral terms which includes the effect of transverse shear deformation without using shear correction factors. The visco-Pastemak's medium is introduced by considering the damping effect to the classical foundation model which modeled by the linear Winkler's coefficient and Pastemak's (shear) foundation coefficient. The SLGS under consideration is subjected to compressive in- plane edge loads per unit length. The influences of many parameters such as nonlocal parameter, geometric ratio, the visco-Pastemak's coefficients, damping parameter, and mode numbers on the buckling response of the SLGSs are studied and discussed.|| The present work investigated the application of granular activated carbon (GAC) derived from date palm pits (DPP) agricultural waste for treating gaseous ammonia. Respective findings indicate increased breakthrough time (run time at which 5% of influent ammonia is exiting with the effluent gas) with a decrease in influent ammonia and increase in GAC bed depth. At a gas flow rate of 1.1 L/min and GAC column length of 8 cm, the following breakthrough trend was noted: 1295 min (2.5 ppmv) > 712 min (5 ppmv) > 532 min (7.5 ppmv). A qualitatively similar trend was also noted for the exhaustion time results (run time at which 95% of influent ammonia is exiting with the effluent gas). The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) findings for the produced GAC indicated some salient functional groups at the produced GAC surface including O-H, C-H, C-O, and S=O groups. Ammonia adsorption was suggested to result from its interaction with the respective surface functional groups via different mechanisms. Comparison with a commercial GAC showed the date palm pits based GAC to be having slightly higher breakthrough and exhaustion capacity.|| In this research, a simple four-variable trigonometric integral shear deformation model is proposed for the static behavior of advanced functionally graded (AFG) ceramic-metal plates supported by a two-parameter elastic foundation and subjected to a nonlinear hygro-thermo-mechanical load. The elastic properties, including both the thermal expansion and moisture coefficients of the plate, are also supposed to be varied within thickness direction by following a power law distribution in terms of volume fractions of the components of the material. The interest of the current theory is seen in its kinematics that use only four independent unknowns, while first-order plate theory and other higher-order plate theories require at least five unknowns. The ""in-plane displacement field"" of the proposed theory utilizes cosine functions in terms of thickness coordinates to calculate out-of-plane shear deformations. The vertical displacement includes flexural and shear components. The elastic foundation is introduced in mathematical modeling as a two-parameter Winkler-Pastemak foundation. The virtual displacement principle is applied to obtain the basic equations and a Navier solution technique is used to determine an analytical solution. The numerical results predicted by the proposed formulation are compared with results already published in the literature to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed theory. The influences of ""moisture concentration"", temperature, stiffness of foundation, shear deformation, geometric ratios and volume fraction variation on the mechanical behavior of AFG plates are examined and discussed in detail.|| In this paper, experimental, numerical and analytical investigations were carried out to study the structural behavior of concrete-filled stainless steel tubular (CFSST) stub columns externally wrapped by carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites under eccentric compression loading. In the experimental work, twelve stub columns of 101 mm outer diameter and 2 mm thickness were tested. The main variables considered were the thickness of the CFRP wrap (t(f)) and the load eccentricity to the outer diameter ratio (e/D). A 3D finite element (FE) simulation was developed for the CFRP-bonded CFSST stub columns using the well-known commercial FE program ABAQUS and validated against the experimental results. The validated FE models were further utilized to generate more data with different variables. From the experimental and numerical results, it was found that the CFRP wrapping effectively improves the ultimate strength of the CFRP-bonded CFSST stub columns. Finally, an analytical axial force-bending moment (P-M) interaction model was proposed. It provided conservative predictions when compared to the experimental and FE results.|| The loss of composite action at the hogging moment zone for a continuous composite girder reduces the girder stiffness and strength. This paper presents an experimental investigation of the use of an ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) slab at the hogging moment zone and a normal concrete (NC) slab at the sagging moment zone. The testing was conducted to verify the level of loading at which composite action is maintained at the hogging moment zone. Four two-span continuous composite girders were tested. The thickness of the UHPC varied between a half and a full depth of slab. The degree of shear connection at the hogging moment zone varied between full and partial. The experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the UHPC slab to enhance the girder stiffness and maintain the composite action at the hogging moment zone at a load level much higher than the upper service load limit. To a lesser degree enhanced performance was also noted for the smaller thickness of the UHPC slab and partial shear connection at the hogging moment zone. Plastic analysis was conducted to evaluate the ultimate capacity of the girder which yielded a conservative estimation. Finite element (FE) modeling evaluated the girder performance numerically and yielded satisfactory results. The results indicated that composite action at the hogging moment zone is maintained for the degree of shear connection taken as 50% of the full composite action and use of UHPC as half depth of slab thickness.|| In this study, human exposure and risks of metals through fish ingestion were predicted. Concentrations of 10 metals (Cd, As, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn) in 17 commonly eaten fish species in Saudi Arabia were characterized. Using the fish ingestion patterns, chronic daily intakes of metals among the Saudi and expatriate populations were predicted to be in the ranges of 8.89 x 10(-06)-1.08 x 10(-02) and 6.59 x 10(-06)-7.97 x 10(-03) mg/kg/day, respectively. The average cancer risks from inorganic arsenic were 2.76 x 10(-05) and 2.09 x 10(-05) for Saudi and expatriate, and the ranges were 1.61 x 10(-09)-1.58 x 10(-03) and 2.64 x 10(-09)-1.27 x 10(-03), respectively. The predicted risks were much lower than the previously reported risks. There were 47.4% and 42.4% chances that cancer risks would be higher than 1.0 x 10(-05) (10 per million) among Saudi and expatriate, respectively. The average cumulative hazard index (HI) for Saudi and expatriate were 0.324 and 0.239 with the ranges of 0.0142-7.26 and 0.017-6.43, respectively. Approximately 3.06% and 1.56% cases among Saudi and expatriate had HI greater than unity, indicating possible health concern, respectively. Through comprehensive understanding of exposure and risks, strategies can be adopted to protect human health.|| In this work, the buckling and vibrational behavior of the composite beam armed with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SW-CNT) resting on Winkler-Pasternak elastic foundation are investigated. The CNT-RC beam is modeled by a novel integral first order shear deformation theory. The current theory contains three variables and uses the shear correction factors. The equivalent properties of the CNT-RC beam are computed using the mixture rule. The equations of motion are derived and resolved by Applying the Hamilton's principle and Navier solution on the current model. The accuracy of the current model is verified by comparison studies with others models found in the literature. Also, several parametric studies and their discussions are presented.|| Exposure to disinfection byproducts (DBPs) in municipal water mainly occurs through ingestion, inhalation during showering, house cleaning and dermal permeation. While showering, the air-phase DBPs [e.g., trihalomethanes (THMs)] can pose risk to humans through inhalation pathway. In assessing inhalation risk during showering, current approaches assume negligible initial concentrations of air-phase THMs in shower stalls, which may not be realistic in places with common shower stalls (e.g., gymnasiums). The time difference between successive showering events in these places is likely to be minimal, resulting in significant initial concentrations of THMs due to prior showering events. In this study, exposure to air-phase THMs during the successive showering events were predicted. In the 2nd showering event, averages of chronic daily intake (CDI), cancer risk (CR) and hazard index (HI) were 1.82, 1.83 and 1.85 times the CDI, CR and HI in the first event, respectively. In the 3rd event, these were 2.50, 2.54 and 2.58 times, respectively. The increasing trends of CDI, CR and HI were observed for up to the 9th event (5.06, 4.98 and 5.60 times, respectively). By widening the time-gap between the successive showering events, reducing showering duration and enhancing ventilation, human exposure and risk can be controlled. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Although most studies have focused on selenite (SeO32-) and selenate (SeO42-) removal, however selenocyanate (SeCN-) is another Se-species whose treatment is challenging often because of a complex wastewater matrix and presence of co-pollutants such as phenol. The present study therefore investigated the efficiency of TiO2 photocatalysis (with EDTA as a hole/h(+) scavenger) for the treatment of mixed selenocyanate/phenol wastewater along with response surface methodology (RSM) based process optimization, determination of reaction intermediates, and kinetic modeling. The application of face-centered central composite design (CCD) RSM modeling yielded Natural Log Transformed Linear model for selenium removal, and non-transformed two-factor interaction model for phenol removal. These models were duly validated using statistical tools, and then tested employing additional experiments. The optimal process conditions for maximum selenium and phenol removal were found to be pH 4, 10 ppm selenocyanate, 5 ppm phenol, and 450 ppm EDTA. Findings from the reaction byproducts analysis indicated selenite, selenate, benzenediols, and benzeneseleninic acid as most noted intermediates. A kinetic model that predicts the changes in parent compounds selenocyanate/phenol and dominant reaction intermediates during photocatalysis is also presented.|| This work investigates a new type of quasi-3D hyperbolic shear deformation theory is proposed in this study to discuss the statics and free vibration of functionally graded porous plates resting on elastic foundations. Material properties of porous FG plate are defined by rule of the mixture with an additional term of porosity in the through-thickness direction. By including indeterminate integral variables, the number of unknowns and governing equations of the present theory is reduced, and therefore, it is easy to use. The present approach to plate theory takes into account both transverse shear and normal deformations and satisfies the boundary conditions of zero tensile stress on the plate surfaces. The equations of motion are derived from the Hamilton principle. Analytical solutions are obtained for a simply supported plate. Contrary to any other theory, the number of unknown functions involved in the displacement field is only five, as compared to six or more in the case of other shear and normal deformation theories. A comparison with the corresponding results is made to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the present theory. The influences of the porosity parameter, power-law index, aspect ratio, thickness ratio and the foundation parameters on bending and vibration of porous FG plate.|| In this study, a novel adsorbent was prepared from eggshells using inexpensive single-step modification method. Chemical surface modification of eggshell samples that were collected from local homes was investigated using three modifying agents, namely, NaOH, HNO3 and KMnO4 at different concentrations and contact times. The produced adsorbents were investigated for lead removal from aqueous solution. The obtained results on removal efficiencies were statistically analyzed with the response surface method. The obtained results revealed that samples modified with KMnO4 showed high affinities for lead ions, when compared with those modified with NaOH and HNO3. The statistical analysis demonstrated that the modifying agent has a significant role in the modification process. Poor statistical models were developed for samples modified with NaOH and HNO3. However, a reliable model was developed for samples modified with KMnO4, which was adequately used to predict the responses. Modified and unmodified eggshell samples were characterized using standard methods that included X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, scanning electron microscope/energy dispersive spectrometer. The characterization outcome indicated that manganese oxides were successfully loaded on the eggshell surfaces. Moreover, the porous structure of the modified eggshell was noticeably enhanced and the BET surface area of the modified eggshell at the best conditions was found to be 90 m(2)/g. The obtained results showed that eggshell waste could be used efficiently as a promising low-cost adsorbent for metal removal using simple direct modification process. Effects of operational parameters showed that lead removal efficiency increased with pH and adsorbent dosage, while it was decreased with increasing the initial concentration. The experimental data at the equilibrium was best fitted to Langmuir isotherm with a maximum adsorption capacity of 700 mg/g and removal efficiency of 98%. Kinetic studies indicated that the pseudo-second-order model best fitted the experimental data. The thermodynamic study revealed that the free energy, Delta G, was found to be negative, which indicates that the adsorption was spontaneous and favorable. Furthermore, the positive value of enthalpy, Delta H, (55 kJ/mole) indicated that the adsorption was endothermic. Chemisorption mechanism of lead removal using K-ES was confirmed since the activation energy, Ea, which was found to be more than 40 kJ/mole.|| This study involves the application of electrocoagulation process to remove arsenite from simulated groundwater using steel, aluminium, platinum and glassy carbon in a 2-L batch reactor setup. It was observed that arsenite was initially oxidized to arsenate. In the case of glassy carbon and platinum electrodes, arsenate build-up was found in the solution due to the lack of floc formation. However, in the case of steel and aluminium electrodes, the flocs generated effectively adsorbed the arsenate produced. Parametric studies reveal the highest removal efficiency of arsenite at low pH, high current and low concentration, with the optimum removal according to surface response methodology achieved at pH 4, 1.2 A and 10 ppm. Electrical energy consumption evaluation shows that operating at the optimum conditions, 653.33 kWh/kg is required to achieve WHO limit from an initial arsenite concentration of 10 ppm. Kinetic studies indicate that the rate is best described by first-order model. The sludges obtained after the electrocoagulation process using the steel and aluminium electrodes further reveal the adsorption of arsenic species onto the metal hydroxide surfaces.|| This study proposes efficient exterior concrete walls (consisting of blocks, mortars, and plasters) to reduce the heat transfer to or from buildings for minimizing energy consumption due to air conditioning or heating processes. Different blocks were treated by partially or totally replacing coarse and fine aggregates with insulation materials. Mortars and plasters were also treated by partially replacing sand with certain insulation materials. A control block (without treatment) was also produced with three-row rectangular cavities to reduce the effective thermal conductivity. Experimental tests were performed to determine the thermal conductivity of blocks, mortars, and plasters, and to validate a developed three-dimensional model (using ANSYS-Fluent program). The model results showed a substantial increase in model accuracy (about 15%) by involving the estimation of radiation heat transfer in the block cavities. The thermal and economic performance of treated masonry walls showed that the optimal performance was obtained from a wall having volcanic scoria-treated blocks (200-mm thick) and 15% vermiculite-treated mortar (10-mm thick). The thermal performance was enhanced by 15% and 318% (for thermal resistance increase) and 13% and 76% (for heat flux reduction) more than those of the control and market walls, respectively. Adding 15% vermiculite-treated plaster (2 x 15-mm thick) to the wall enhanced the thermal performance remarkably. The total cost of the improved wall (having the highest thermal resistance) was reduced by 1.39 and 3.67 times over the control and market walls (Dhahran, Saudi Arabia), respectively. This improved wall is a promising candidate for exterior walls in residential and industrial buildings.|| Disinfection byproducts (DBPs) in drinking water is an issue in many countries. Many DBPs are possible or probable human carcinogens while few DBPs pose cyto- and genotoxic effects to the mammalian cells. The populations arc likely to consume DBPs with drinking water throughout their lifetimes. A number of DBPs are regulated in many countries to protect humans. In this study, human exposure, risk and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) were predicted from DBPs in multiple water supply systems, including groundwater (GW), desalinated water (DW) and blend water (BW). The averages of lifetime excess cancer risks from GW, DW and BW were 4.15 x 10(-6), 1.75 x 10(-5) and 2.59 x 10(-5) respectively. The populations in age groups of 0- <2, 2-16 and >16 years contributed 254-25.7%, 28.6-29.6% and 45.0-45.7% to the total risks respectively. The DALY from GW, DW and BW were estimated to be 5.8,27.0 and 39.9 years, respectively while the corresponding financial burdens were US$ 0.63, 2.93 and 4.34 million respectively. The findings are likely to assist in selecting the supply water sources to better control human exposure and risk from DBPs. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Hence, a finite element model (FEM) was developed to find out the optimum geometry of cavities and their layout in masonry concrete blocks in order to reduce the thermal flow of heat and the results were compared with that of hollow blocks available in the market in terms of thermal insulation. Results of the simulation were promising and indicated that the new ""optimum"" designed geometry of hollow blocks was much better than the hollow blocks available in the market. Thereafter, some insulation materials were utilized in the concrete mixtures to produce hollow masonry concrete blocks to reduce the thermal conductivity through wall elements. Experimentally, the results of the new block with optimum geometry without the insulation materials showed improved thermal insulation by as much as 71% compared to other designs of hollow blocks including those available in the market. The thermal resistance of concrete and masonry blocks with the insulation materials (perlite, rubber and polyethylene) was enticing and significant. The newly developed optimum design of masonry concrete block with and without the insulation materials satisfied the ASTM C129 requirements for non-load bearing walls in terms of strength and absorption and was considered as medium weight (without insulation material) and as lightweight (with insulation materials) masonry hollow blocks. Results of this comprehensive investigation also indicated that the thermal conductivity could be reduced by up to 40% compared to that of the conventional blocks available in the market. Therefore, it is recommended that these optimum designed blocks be utilized by the construction industry in order to reduce the amount of energy used for the air conditioning as well as the carbon footprrint.

Bothh-refinement around the fracture front andp-enrichment of the analysis domain are used to control discretization errors. A Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) model based on Griffith's criterion is adopted. LEFM scaling relations are used at each fracture propagation step to back calculate SIFs that meet Griffith's criterion. As a result, no iterations are necessary to find loading scaling parameters or fracture size that meets Griffith's criterion. The method is validated against several experimental data sets for mode I and mode I+II fracture propagation problems. Very good agreement between SGFEM and experimental results is observed. These include fracture path, Crack Opening Displacement (COD), and load and fracture length versus COD curves. The computational efficiency of the method is also assessed.|| Predicting crash injury severity is a crucial constituent of reducing the consequences of traffic crashes.

11,Center of Research Excellence in Renewable Energy,Research Institue,74,342,16,45,13,21.62,60.81,17.57,64.86,24.32,10.81,48,18,8,"|| Fatty alcohols have been identified as promising organic phase change materials (PCMs) for thermal energy storage, because of their suitable temperature range, nontoxicity and can be obtained from both natural and synthetic sources. Like all other organic PCMs, octadecanol (OD) as PCM suffers from low thermal conductivity (TC). In this work, to enhance its TC, it was grafted on the functionalized MWCNT and were used as a conductive filler to enhance overall thermal properties of OD in a composite PCM (CPCMs) structure. The OD/OD-g-MWCNT sample showed better dispersion within the composites and the presence of additional OD boosted the overall heat storage enthalpy compared to that of plane composite sample with OD/MWCNT. In a non-quantitative approach, it was observed that, any increase in grafting ratio of OD increases the heat storage enthalpy of the composites. The heat storage enthalpy of (267.7J/g) OD/OD-g-MWCNT(4:1)-5wt% composite PCM had reached very close to the heat storage enthalpy value of pure OD (269.3J/g), and much higher than that of OD/MWCNT-5wt% (234.5J/g). Champion sample i.e. OD/OD-g-MWCNT (4:1)-5wt%, showed good heat storage enthalpy, cycling performance, thermal stability and TC enhancement by 262.5%.|| Significant growth in solar photovoltaic (PV) installation has been observed during the last decade in standalone and grid-connected power generation systems. However, the PV system has a non-linear output characteristic because of weather intermittency, which tends to a substantial loss in overall system output. Thus, to optimize the output of the PV system, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques are used to track the global maximum power point (GMPP) and extract the maximum power from the PV system under different weather conditions with better precision. Since MPPT is an essential part of the PV system, to date, many MPPT methods have been developed by various researchers, each with unique features. A Google Scholar survey of the last five years (2015-2020) was performed to investigate the number of review articles published. It was found that overall, seventy-one review articles were published on different MPPT techniques; out of those, only four were on non-uniform solar irradiance, and seven review articles included shading conditions. Unfortunately, very few attempts were made in this regard. Therefore, a comprehensive review paper on this topic is needed, in which almost all the well-known MPPT techniques should be encapsulated in one document. This article focuses on online and soft-computing MPPT algorithm classifications under non-uniform irradiance conditions along with their mathematical expression, operating principles, and block diagram/flow charts. It will provide a direction for future research and development in the field of maximum power point tracking optimization.|| Ion transport membrane (ITM) is considered to be one of the promising techniques for the separation of oxygen from the air for clean energy applications. Studying flow configurations of gases around Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) membrane is presented and discussed in this paper. The effects of the sweep mass flow rate and impingement configurations for the gases flow in the feed and permeation sides have been investigated. In this regard, flow with single or double impingement and impingement with different angles have been simulated and analyzed in order to identify the configurations that would provide the maximum permeation flux. Results show that increasing the sweep flow rate, directly, increases the oxygen permeation flux. It is also found that, in case of single impingement, decreasing the distance between the nozzle and the membrane (H), directly, increases the oxygen permeation flux for constant sweep side nozzle (slot) width (D). The permeation flux increases from around 2.9-3.66 mu mole/cm(2) s for the ratio H:D from1:1 to 1:4 (i.e., decreasing H to one-fourth of its value). Results show that the double impingement flow gives lower results than the single impingements by about 35.7%. The results also revealed that the optimum configuration is the parallel flow with vacuum in the sweeping side, which gives the highest permeation flux with an increase of more than 41% from that of the parallel configuration with a sweeping gas. Using carbon dioxide as a sweeping gas is better than helium.|| Here, environmental dust cleaning from an inclined hydrophobic surface by rolling liquid droplets has been studied and the influence of fluid droplets on the dust removal rate has been examined. The distilled and carbonated water droplets at different volumes were incorporated and the inclination angle of the dusty hydrophobic surface on the droplet motion was explored in the experiments. We demonstrated that the carbonated water droplet had higher translational velocity than the distilled water droplet on the dusty hydrophobic surface. The bubbles formed around the droplet surface acted as gas cushions at the interface between the solid surface and the fluid droplet while lowering the friction and pinning forces and enhancing the droplet translational velocity on the surface. Collected environmental dust has various components, some of which can dissolve in water while creating resorption/nucleation centers for bubble formation in the carbonated water droplet. The interaction between the bubbles and the dust particles at the liquid-solid interface enhanced the rate of dust particle movement into carbonated water. For a small-volume droplet (20 mu L) at a low surface inclination angle (delta = 1 degrees), the rolling motion of the distilled and carbonated water droplets ceased on the hydrophobic surface at early periods.|| Low-frequency oscillations should be dealt with extreme care for secure electric networks. This paper tunes the critical parameters of power system stabilizers in three different electric networks in real-time, employing the neurogenetic approach to damp out the low-frequency oscillations. The first network is a single machine infinite bus power system equipped with a power system stabilizer. Besides, the second and third networks are coordinated with second-generation flexible alternating current transmission system devices, namely a unified power flow controller and static synchronous compensator in coordination with power system stabilizers, respectively. The investigation of eigenvalue and minimum damping ratio analyses for different loading conditions proves the efficiency of the proposed approach. Additionally, the time-domain simulation comparison shows the superiority of the proposed approach over the conventional method. Besides, the satisfactory values of the statistical performance measures give confidence to the proposed approach in predicting power system stabilizer parameters and thus mitigating the low-frequency oscillations in real-time.

The laser texturing of alumina surface is carried out to obtain hydrophobic surface and later the textured surface is replicated by polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) via a solvent casting method. An experiment is carried out to assess the water droplet pinning on the replicated inclined PDMS surface while keeping the replicated surface at uniform temperature (308 K). The flow and temperature fields inside the inclined water droplet are simulated in line with the experimental conditions. The flow velocities inside the droplet are validated through the data obtained from the particle imaging velocimetry (PIV). It is found that the velocity predictions agree well with the PIV data. The droplet heating results in a circulation cell inside the droplet due to the Marangoni and the buoyancy currents. Increasing inclination angle of the PDMS replicated surface enhances the maximum velocity inside the droplet, which is more pronounced for the large size droplets. The Nusselt and the Bond numbers increase with the inclination angle of the PDMS surface.|| In this work, single-crystalline large-scale LaCO3OH nanoprism morphologies were synthesized by controlling La and Ca molar ratio and the hydrothermal reaction conditions. The nanoprism morphologies of LaCO3OH were unique in nature with a sharp corner and smooth surfaces. The hydrothermal reaction was carried out in the absence of organic additives or templates and (NH4)(2)CO3 was used as a precipitation agent. The molar ratio of La:Ca was varied over the following values (the sample shorthand is given in parentheses): 75:25 mol% (LC-1), 50:50 mol% (LC-2), and 25:75 mol% (LC-3). Phase-pure LaCO3OH nanoprisms formed at a La:Ca molar ratio of 75:25 mol% without any assistance of catalysts or template. The photoluminescence (PL) properties of the as-synthesized powders showed one broad emission band centered at 394 nm after excitation of the pure LC-3 LaCO3OH nanoprisms at lambda = 280 nm. The PL intensities were decreased in the order of LC-1 < LC-2< LC-3. The LC-1 and LC-2 samples had almost the same PL intensities probably due to their unique and smooth particle morphology. The calcination result of three samples treated for two hours at 800 degrees C, shows a reduction in NO activities over highly distributed CaO comprising La2O3. Further, under the presence of H2O and O-2 vapor(,) CaO comprising La2O3 catalysts shows higher stability for the reduction of NO with CH4.|| Thermal efficiency of passive building designs can be improved using phase change materials (PCMs). This study was focused on the development and lab-scale thermoregulation performance of wood fiber(WF)/capric acid-stearic acid(CA-SA) eutectic mixture as low-cost and eco-friendly composite PCM for thermal energy storage (TES). The composite including 52 wt% PCM showed leak-proof property. The structural/morphological characteristics, TES properties, cycling TES reliability and chemical stability of the leak-proof CPCM were investigated by SEM, FT-IR, XRD, DSC, and TGA techniques. The lab-scale thermoregulation performance of CPCM board was also evaluated experimentally. The SEM results indicated that the eutectic PCM was successfully impregnated with WF as the spectral findings confirmed the good compatibility among its constituents. DSC results demonstrated that the CPCM had a melting temperature of 23.38 degrees C and latent heat of 92.1 J/g. TGA measurements revealed that the servicing temperature of the CPCM was much over than its thermal decomposition limit. It had stable TES properties and chemical structure after 600 melting-freezing cycles. Furthermore, lab-scale performance test exhibited that the temperature difference at the inside center of CPCM cubic cell and WF cubic cell was ascertained as averagely 2.67 degrees C during a 72 min-heating period and 1.18 degrees C during a 100 mincooling period.

Air cooling management was done through thermoelectric coolers, and an Arduino microcontroller with various sensors such as a temperature sensor, simple RF modules, and actuators was used to control the indoor climatic conditions based on outdoor conditions. The result shows that when the input power supply to the IoT-based TE-AC system is increased, the cooling capacity of the framework is also enhanced. Significant power and carbon emission reduction was observed for the IoT-based TE-AC system as compared to the TE-AC system without IoT. The IoT-incorporated system also ensures better microclimatic temperature control. Additionally, the system cooling capacity improves by 14.0%, and the coefficient of performance is increased by 46.3%. Thus, this study provides a smart solution to the two major energy harvesting issues of traditional air conditioners-an increase in energy efficiency by employing a TE-AC system and a further improvement in efficiency by using an IoT-based thermal management system.|| The solar collector's efficiency is directly depended upon the solar radiation intensity falling on its surface. In order to increase the solar concentration over the collector, side reflectors are introduced which will concentrate both diffuse and direct radiations from the sun toward the collector surface. Therefore, in this study the influence of side (left and right) reflectors on efficiency improvement of the flat plate solar collector (FPSC) was analyzed. For determining the optimum tilt angles of side reflector and collector, a simulation model was developed by using TRNSYS software. The results obtained from simulation were validated with the experimental results for whole year during the daytime of semiarid Asir region of Saudi Arabia. Both simulation and experimental results indicate that optimal left side reflector angle is lowest in winter with the value of 38 degrees and highest in summer with the value of 68 degrees, while the optimal angle of right side reflector is lowest in summer with the value of 43 degrees and highest in winter with the value of 74.5 degrees. The thermal efficiency of FPSC has been improved significantly by adding side reflectors. The average thermal efficiency of FPSC without reflector was 46% which was increased to 58% by adding side reflectors. The addition of side reflectors increases the concentration of solar radiation falling on the collector surface and thus increases the output temperature of water by 12 degrees C as compared to input water temperature. Thus, the effective size of the system was reduced by adding side reflectors as thermal efficiency was enhanced which implies less space requirement for heating an appropriate quantity of water.|| In this work, polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a phase change material (PCM) was incorporated with palygorskite (Pal) clay to develop a novel form-stable composite PCM (F-SCPCM). The Pal/PEG(40 wt%) composite was defined as F-SCPCM and characterized using SEM/EDS, FT-IR, XRD, DSC, and TGA techniques. The DSC results revealed that the F-SCPCM has a melting temperature of 32.5 degrees C and latent heat capacity of 64.3 J/g for thermal energy storage (TES) applications. Thermal cycling test showed that the F-SCPCM had good cycling thermal/chemical stability after 500 cycles. The TGA data proved that that both cycled and non-cycled F-SCPCMs had considerable high thermal durability. Consequently, the created F-SCPCM could be considered as an additive material for production of green construction components with TES capability. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 2020. (c) 2020 Society of Plastics Engineers|| A significant growth in solar photovoltaic (PV) installation has observed during the last decade in standalone and grid-connected power generation systems. The solar PV system has a non-linear output characteristic because of weather intermittency, which tends to have a substantial effect on overall PV system output. Hence, to optimize the output of a PV system, different maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques have been used. But, the confusion lies while selecting an appropriate MPPT, as every method has its own merits and demerits. Therefore, a proper review of these techniques is essential. A ""Google Scholar"" survey of the last five years (2015-2020) was conducted. It has found that overall seventy-one review articles are published on different MPPT techniques; out of those seventy-one, only four are on uniform solar irradiance, seven on non-uniform and none on hybrid optimization MPPT techniques. Most of them have discussed the limited number of MPPT techniques, and none of them has discussed the online and offline under uniform and hybrid MPPT techniques under non-uniform solar irradiance conditions all together in one. Unfortunately, very few attempts have made in this regard. Therefore, a comprehensive review paper on this topic is need of time, in which almost all the well-known MPPT techniques should be encapsulated in one paper. This article focuses on classifications of online, offline, and hybrid optimization MPPT algorithms, under the uniform and non-uniform irradiance conditions. It summarizes various MPPT methods along with their mathematical expression, operating principle, and block diagram/flow charts. This research will provide a valuable pathway to researchers, energy engineers, and strategists for future research and implementation in the field of maximum power point tracking optimization.|| Subjective analysis of thermal comfort of occupants relates to the recording of the level of satisfaction or dissatisfaction of occupants with regard to indoor environmental conditions on a scale which ranges from & x2212;5 to & x002B;5. This requires recruitment of subjects and matching for gender, age etc. In this study, we have tried to predict the thermal comfort of occupants by observing their real behavior inside the test room fitted with a novel thermoelectric air duct (TE-AD) cooling system rather than a conventional air conditioning system. Firstly, real experimental data were collected for more than two months from the test room equipped with the TE-AD cooling system operated at an input power supply of 6 A and 5 V. After that, the ANN model was developed based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm by taking experimental parameters such as air temperature, relative humidity, globe temperature, wind speed, metabolic rate, and clothing value as model input. The ANN model is optimized by developing different models with different data points as a starting input in the training and validation process. The neuron optimization has been carried out in these models to minimize the mean square error (MSE) for the ANN model. The result shows that among the three models M1, M2, and M3, the optimum predictive mean value (PMV) was obtained from M1 at 10 neurons with MSE of 0.07956, while for predicted percentage dissatisfied (PPD), M3 gives optimum accuracy at 10 neurons with MSE value of 5.1789. The ANN model is then generalized to predict thermal comfort for one week and then for one month. Finally, all the model results were validated with the experimental data.|| The strengthening of electric energy security and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions have gained enormous momentum in previous decades. The integration of large-scale intermittent renewable energy resources (RER) like wind energy into the existing electricity grids has increased significantly in the last decade. However, this integration poses many operational and control challenges that hamper the reliable and stable operation of the grids. This article aims to review the reported challenges caused by the integration of wind energy and the proposed solutions methodologies. Among the various challenges, the generation uncertainty, power quality issues, angular and voltage stability, reactive power support, and fault ride-through capability are reviewed and discussed. Besides, socioeconomic, environmental, and electricity market challenges due to the grid integration of wind power are also investigated. Many of the solutions used and proposed to mitigate the impact of these challenges, such as energy storage systems, wind energy policy, and grid codes, are also reviewed and discussed. This paper will assist the enthusiastic readers in seeing the full picture of wind energy integration challenges. It also puts in the hands of policymakers all aspects of the challenges so that they can adopt sustainable policies that support and overcome the difficulties facing the integration of wind energy into electricity grids.|| Solar desalination systems often have limited operating hours and their operation is significantly affected by the variation of solar radiation intensity. A model of a humidification-dehumidification (HDH) desalination system integrated with evacuated tube solar collectors and thermal storage is developed and validated against available data in the literature. Operating parameters such as the maximum temperature of water heater and the mass flow rate ratio of the HDH component are optimized. The thermal storage unit consists of separate hot and cold-water storage tanks, which allow control of the water temperature leaving the storage unit. Furthermore, performance of the system for six different geographical locations in Saudi Arabia, namely Riyadh, Jeddah, Dhahran, Qassim, Sharurah, and Tabuk, is studied. The system is evaluated for four different scenarios as follows: (i) 24-h operation; (ii) with the ideal flow rate; (iii) with the average flow rate; and (iv) with the maximum flow rate. The effect of flow rate on the number of operating hours and the rate of freshwater production is also evaluated. The maximum freshwater production is 9.346 L/h and the minimum is 3.01 L/h. For a service life of 20 years, the cost of freshwater produced varies from 0.021 to 0.034 $/L considering interest rate of 2%.|| The self-cleaning of surfaces via impacting water droplets is examined pertinent to solar energy applications. The mechanism of spreading and retraction of the impacting droplet onto the dust and cleaned hydrophobic surfaces is considered in the analysis. The spreading factor of the impacting droplet is formulated incorporating the energy balance on the hydrophobic surface. High-speed photography is used to monitor the impacting droplet behavior. The functionalized silica particles coating is introduced towards generating hydrophobic wetting state on the glass surfaces. Environmental dust particles are characterized prior to self-cleaning impacting tests. It is found that spreading rate predicted for the impacting droplet agrees well with that obtained from the experiments. The droplet Weber number incorporated in the experiments does not result in droplet breaking on the surface upon impacting. The dusts are dissimilar in shapes and consist of several elements. Impacting droplet gives rise to cloaking of the dust on the surface during spreading and retraction. Almost all the dusts are removed from the surface through the impacting droplets; however, few dust residues are left on the impacting surface, which cover only 0.03% of the total surface area. Hence, we have demonstrated that self-cleaning of a surface can be achieved by an impacting droplet for renewable energy applications.|| Droplet heat transfer in between parallelly located superhydrophobic plates is examined. The thermal field inside the droplet is predicted by adopting the experimental conditions. The influence of plates spacing (heights) on the thermal response of the droplet fluid is investigated. Particle injection velocimetry (PIV) is used to validate the velocity predictions. We demonstrated that predictions of flow velocity are in agreement with those of the PIV results. The heating of the droplet in the absence of the top plate gives four circulation cells in the droplet. Once the top superhydrophobic plate is introduced, the flow structure alters, and the number of the circulating structures reduces to two. Lowering the height of the plates increases the droplet Laplace pressure while modifying the fluid flow and thermal behavior. The Bond number is lower than one for all the cases considered; hence, demonstrating that the Marangoni force affects the formation of the circulation cells. The cells redistribute the heated fluid in the droplet interior, which is clearly apparent for the plates with small heights. Temperature enhancement in the droplet bottom section is attributed to the flow current formed due to heat diffusion. The Nusselt number corresponding to the bottom plate increases as the plate heights reduces; however, the opposite is true for that corresponding to the top plate.|| In recent year, fatty acids (FAs) are heavily studied for heat storage applications and they have shown promising advantages over other organic phase change materials (PCMs). Among the FAs; capric, palmitic and stearic acids are the most studied PCMs. Several researchers have investigated these FAs and tried to improve their thermal properties, mainly by adding different high conducting fillers, such as graphite, metal foams, CNTs, graphene etc. In most cases, these fillers improved the thermal conductivity and heat transfer property but reduce the heat storage capacity considerably. These composites also lose the mixing uniformity during the charging and discharging process. To overcome these issues, selected FAs were grafted on the functionalized CNT surfaces and used as conductive fillers to prepare FA based composite PCMs. This process significantly contributed to prevent the drastic reduction of the overall heat storage capacity and also showed better dispersion in both solid and liquid state. Thermal cycling test showed the variations in the thermal energy storage values of all composite PCMs, however, within the tolerable grade and they had appreciable phase change stability and good chemical stability even after 2,000 cycles.|| Water droplet cleaning of a dusty hydrophobic surface is examined. Environmental dust are used in the experiments and cloaking velocity of a dust layer by a droplet fluid is measured and hemi-wicking conditions for the dust layer are analyzed adopting the pores media wick structure approach. A droplet motion on dusty and inclined hydrophobic surface is analyzed using a high speed digital imaging system. Influences of dust layer thickness, droplet volume, and surface inclination angle on the mechanisms of dust removal by a rolling droplet are evaluated. The findings revealed that dust cloaking velocity decreases exponentially with time. The droplet fluid can cloak the dust layer during its transition on the dusty surface. The transition period of droplet wetted length on the dusty surface remains longer than the cloaking time of the dust layer by the droplet fluid. Translational velocity of rolling droplet is affected by the dust layer thickness, which becomes apparent for small volume droplets. Small volume droplet (20 mu L) terminates on the thick dust layer (150 mu m) at low surface inclination angle (1 degrees). The quantity of dust picked up by the rolling droplet increases as the surface inclination angle increases. The amount of dust residues remaining on the rolling droplet path is relatively larger for the thick dust layer (150 mu m) as compared to its counterpart of thin dust layer (50 mu m).|| Mitigation of environmental dust from surfaces becomes one of the challenges for maintaining the optical characteristics of surfaces. Dust repelling from hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces under vibrational excitation is investigated and the percentage of dust repelled from surfaces is evaluated. The characteristics of the dust particles are examined and dust adhesion on surfaces under molecular forces (van der Walls) is explored. High speed recording system is utilized to monitor dust repelling from the surfaces. The dust residues, which are not repelled from the sample surfaces, are analyzed and the percentage of area coverage of the dust repelled from the surfaces is assessed. The repelling height of the dust is predicted analytically, and the findings are compared with the experimental data. Findings revealed that the analytical predictions of dust repelling height are in good agreement with the experimental data. Due to none-stoichiometric elemental compositions in the dust compounds, ionic forces are created while forming the cluster-like structures because of particle adhesion. The vibrational excitation repels dust from sample surfaces in the form of cluster-like structures. Dust repelled from hydrophobic surface results in a larger clean area on the hydrophobic surface (80% of total surface area) than that of the hydrophilic surface (20% of total surface area).|| Wettability of a droplet liquid on a dusty hydrophobic plate is considered and the fluid infusion into the dust layer is studied pertinent to dust removal from the hydrophobic surfacesviarolling/sliding droplets. Influence of droplet hydrostatic pressure on the fluid infusion into dust layer is also investigated towards exploring the dust removal mechanisms. Environmental dust characteristics are evaluated and their interface with the droplet fluid is assessed. Sets of experiments are carried out to examine: (i) droplet fluid infusion into the dust layer, (ii) droplet fluid cloaking of dust, and (iii) evaluate the weight gain of the dust particles during cloaking. The findings reveal that droplet fluid (water) spreads onto the dusty surface and infuses on the dust particles. Cloaking velocity decays sharply with time and the weight gain of the dust particles is about 17% of the original dust weight after cloaking. The dust particles have a large area of nano-size open-pores-sites on the surface; however, capillary diffusion through these sites is limited with shallow depths and the weight gain of a dust particleviacapillary diffusion is about 1% of the particle weight. The maximum infusion depth of the droplet fluid in the dust layer is about 74 mu m, which is slightly less than the dust layer thickness on the surface. The rolling droplet picks up all the dust from the 150 mu m thick dust layer on the surface.|| Environmental dust is modified towards self-cleaning applications under the gravitational influence. Dust particles are collected in the local area of Dammam in Saudi Arabia and they are treated with a dilute hydrofluoric acid solution. The changes in chemical and adhesion characteristics of the dust particles prior and after the solution treatment are analyzed. Force of adhesion and work required to remove dust from hydrophobic and hydrophilic glass surfaces are assessed, separately, for solution treated and collected dust. We show that aqueous hydrofluoric acid solution treatment modifies some dust components while causing the formation of submicron cracks and nano/submicron porous/pillars like textures on the dust particles. The texture generated on dust surfaces after the solution treatment has a great influence on dust adhesion characteristics. Hence, the solution treated dust particles result in lower adhesion on hydrophobic and hydrophilic glass surfaces as compared to that of untreated dust. The gravitational force enables to remove solution treated dust from inclined glass surfaces, which becomes more apparent for hydrophobic surfaces.|| Dust mitigation from surfaces remains essential, particularly for the efficient operation of energy harnessing devices. Although various dust removal methods have been introduced, the self-cleaning method is favorable because of the cost-effective cleaning process. Dust mitigation from surfaces by water droplets, mimicking nature, is fruitful because it involves low-cost operations. The dust removal rate from surfaces by rolling water droplets can be increased by creating bubbles inside the rolling droplets through which dust pinning on surfaces can be lowered and the droplet liquid infusion on dust surfaces can be enhanced. This study provides insight into bubble formation and dust mitigation in carbonated and distilled water droplets located on hydrophobic surfaces by examining bubble formation and dust distribution inside the water droplets. The behavior of bubbles inside the carbonated water droplet and emanating from the hydrophobic surface was recorded and analyzed by incorporating high-speed camera data. The influence of environmental dust particles on bubble formation was also assessed. Bubble velocity was formulated analytically and the findings are compared with those of the experimental values. Findings revealed that the bubble formation inside the carbonated droplet fluid had a significant effect on the transition of dust particles from the hydrophobic surface towards the droplet fluid. The volume concentration of dust particles in the carbonated water droplet was almost 1.5 to 2.5 times larger than that of the distilled water droplet. The dissolution of alkaline and alkaline earth metal compounds in the carbonated droplet fluid acted like nucleation centers for bubble formation; hence, the number of bubbles formed on the dusty hydrophobic surface was greater than that of the clean hydrophobic surface. Some bubbles attached at the dust particle surface contributed to dust mobility in the droplet fluid, which occurred particularly in the droplet bottom region. This enhanced the velocity of the dust particles transiting from the dusty hydrophobic surface to the droplet fluid inter","|| Thermal energy storage and thermal conductivity properties of

Various behaviors of the connected agents, mainly on undirected graphs, are achieved by well-designed couplings where consensus, formation, and deployment are some examples of the achievable behaviors. Composite behaviors stored in a behavioral bank can be selected by a suitable behavior selection mechanism that is controlled directly by the agent embedded artificial intelligence or indirectly through a mission planning utility. The detailed structure of the framework is provided, where the integration of first integral and nonlinear eigenvalue approaches constitute its core is presented. The nonlinear protocols can be converted into their equivalent linear-like protocols by applying a simple transformation. However, the needed conditions will be the same in both cases. Consensus protocols-both linear like and nonlinear-to achieve arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic means are covered. A generalization using the mean-of-order-p is also provided. Stability and convergence issues are mainly handled using properties of M-matrices and Lasalle's principle. The use of state-dependent parameterization to control behaviors is presented. The multitude of primitive behaviors is used to build a more sophisticated behavioral bank that resides in each agent such that an agent can choose or follow the recently active behavior.|| In this paper, two leader-follower formation control methods are proposed for a fleet of quadrotors. The linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control technique is designed to stabilize the linear models generated at different points in the operating space. The leader-follower approach is used to achieve formation control where the position and the heading of the leader are used with offsets as references to be tracked by the followers. In the first method, the potential field technique is proposed to achieve the desired formation. The attractive potential field attracts the followers towards the leader while the repulsive potential field repulses every two neighboring followers in order to keep a required distance between them and also avoid the collision. In the second method, the followers' positions are dictated by the geometry of the desired formation shape. These followers' positions are expressed in equations that relate them to the leader position and then given to the followers as references to be followed. An extensive simulation is conducted to examine the validity of the results, and the quadrotor non-linear model is used in all simulations. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by IASE.|| Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) such as power plants, water desalination utilities are just a few examples of systems that may come under stealth attacks. These attacks can threaten the proper operations of such systems without any indication. This problem necessitates the design of a control system that is able to work under such attacks. In this paper, an improved observer-based stabilising controller is proposed for CPS including random measurements and actuation delays and it is coming under distributed denial of service (DDoS) and deception attacks. The occurrences of DDoS and deception attacks are modelled as Bernoulli distributed white sequences with variable conditional probabilities. The criterion is presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Detailed simulation experiments on representative systems are shown to prove the applicability of the proposed methodology.|| This research paper aimed to design and present a sensitivity analysis of a hybrid photovoltaic-fuel-cell-battery (PV/FC/B) system to supply a small community for the recently planned grand city NEOM in Saudi Arabia. The location of the city of NEOM is characterized by a high average level of solar irradiance. The average daily horizontal solar radiation is around 5.85 kWh/m(2). A detailed feasibility and techno-economic evaluation of a PV/FC/B hybrid energy system were done to supply a daily load demand of 500 kWh (peak-35 kW). The PV array was the main source to meet the load demand. During the surplus periods, the battery was charged using extra energy and powered the electrolyzer for hydrogen production. The produced hydrogen was stored for later use. During the deficit periods, the FC and/or battery supported the PV array to meet the load demand. Two benchmarks, the cost of energy (COE) and net present cost (NPC), were used to identify the best size of the PV/FC/B system. Variation of the tilt angle of the PV array and the derating factor were considered to determine the effect of the performance of the PV/FC/B system's COE and NPC. The main findings confirmed that a 200 kW PV array, 40 kW FC, 96 batteries, 50 kW converter, 110 kW electrolyzer, and 50 kg hydrogen tank was the best option to supply the load demand. The values of total NPC and COE were $500,823 and $0.126/kWh. The annual excess energy was very sensitive to the declination angle of the PV array. The minimum annual excess energy was achieved at an angle of 30 degrees. It decreased by 75.7% and by 60.6% compared to a horizontal surface and 50 degrees of declination, respectively. To prove the viability of the proposed system, a comparison with grid extension along with a diesel generation system was carried out.|| nan|| It is well known that production scheduling, maintenance and process control decisions affect each other. Hence it is both essential and prudent to optimize them jointly. This paper develops a model that integrates and optimizes production, maintenance and process control decisions simultaneously for a single machine. Both types of maintenance, preventive and corrective, are taken into consideration. The methodology starts by developing an optimal preventive maintenance schedule. Then an integrated model that determines the decision variables and optimizes the total cost per unit time, resulting from production scheduling, inventory holding and maintenance and process control is developed. The utility of the model is demonstrated using an example from the literature. Systematic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the model results are robust. Also; the model results are compared with the results of optimizing each system separately and with two-way integration. The comparisons indicate that the developed model results in a saving that ranged from 2.62 to 6.78 percent. The model provides a viable approach for optimizing production scheduling, maintenance and quality jointly.|| Polling systems are queueing systems consisting of multiple queues served by a single server. In this paper we analyze two types of preemptive time-limited polling systems, the so-called pure and exhaustive time-limited disciplines. In particular, we derive a direct relation for the evolution of the joint queue length during the course of a server visit. The analysis of the pure time-limited discipline builds on and extends several known results for the transient analysis of an M/G/1 queue. For the analysis of the exhaustive discipline we derive several new results for the transient analysis of the M/G/1 queue during a busy period. The final expressions for both types of polling systems that we obtain generalize previous results by incorporating customer routeing, generalized service times, batch arrivals, and Markovian polling of the server.|| A study on mass transfer using new coating materials (namely alginic acid and polygalacturonic acid) during osmotic dehydration-and hence in a laboratory-scale convective dryer to evaluate drying performance-was carried out. Potato and apple samples were examined as model heat-sensitive products in this study. Results indicate that the coating material containing both alginic acid and polygalacturonic acid causes higher water loss of about 17% and 7.5% and lower solid gain of about 4% and 8%, respectively, compared to uncoated potato sample after a typical 90 min osmotic dehydration process. Investigation of drying performance using both coating materials showed a higher reduction in the moisture content of about 22% and 18%, respectively, compared with uncoated samples after the 3 h drying period. Comparisons between the two proposed coating materials were also carried out. Samples (potato) coated with alginic acid demonstrated better performance in terms of higher water loss (WL), lower solid gain (SG), and notable enhancement of drying performance of about 7.5%, 8%, and 8%, respectively, compared to polygalacturonic acid. Similar outcomes were observed using apple samples. Additionally, an accurate model of the drying process based on the experimental dataset was created using an artificial neural network (ANN). The obtained mean square errors (MSEs) for the predicted water loss and solid gain outputs of the potato model were 4.0948e(-5) and 3.924e(-6), respectively. However, these values for the same parameters were 3.164e(-5) and 4.4915e(-6) for the apple model. The coefficient of determination (r(2)) values for the two outputs of the potato model were found to be 0.99969 and 0.99895, respectively, while they were 0.99982 and 0.99913 for the apple model, which reinforces the modeling phase.|| Distributed generation (DG) technology arises in several applications of power supply to tackle the issues of increasing energy demands. The concept of microgrids is introduced to integrate the DG technology into utility power networks. This paper introduces a fuzzy control scheme for networked systems utilizing a quantized H-infinity estimator over communication networks for DGs subject random constraints. The developed estimation algorithm is worthy for ensuring the network stability and enduring any sort of quantization, time delay, and packet drops. In these senses, adequate conditions have been mainly derived by means of linear matrix inequalities. An illustrative examples are demonstrated to confirm the effectiveness of the meant design procedure.|| One of the popular area of research for the past decade in the academia as well as in the industry is networked control systems (NCS). Variable time delays induced by the network and data packet dropout during transmission of data are among the problems encountered in these type of systems. Researchers proposed and developed various control strategies over the past years to deal with the above-mentioned problem. Fuzzy logic control (FLC) is a widely used technique for dealing with control problems, and the most commonly used one is type-1 FLC. However, the interval type-2 (IT2) is proven to be better at handling uncertainties compared to the type-1 FLC. In this paper, a nonlinear NCS with delays is considered, and an observer-based IT2 FLC is designed in order to improve the control of NCS due to the presence of uncertainties and delays. The developed scheme includes the design of a state feedback controller based on IT2 FLC, and an observer-based IT2 FLC using Lyapunov-Krasovskii theory. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, simulations are performed considering various network delays. Firstly, the results of IT2 FLCs are compared with that of type-1 FLCs and improvement is observed. Secondly, the newly developed observer-based IT2 FLC is compared with the IT2 state feedback FLC developed in the literature. Results show faster and more effective response using the newly developed technique.|| A novel technique is proposed to optimize energy efficiency for wireless networks based on hierarchical mobile clustering. The new bi-level clustering technique minimizes mutual interference and energy consumption in large-scale tracking systems used in large public gatherings such as festivals and sports events. This technique tracks random movements of a large number of people in a bounded area by using a combination of smart-phone Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections. It can be effectively used for monitoring health conditions of crowd members and providing their locations and movement directions. An integer linear programming (ILP) model of the problem is formulated to optimize the formation of clusters in a two-level hierarchical structure. In order to evaluate the proposed technique, it is compared to the optimum solutions obtained from the ILP model for both single-level and two-level clustering. Moreover, a Matlab/Simulink simulation model is developed and used to test the technique's performance under realistic operating conditions. The results demonstrate a very good performance of the proposed technique.|| The optimal design of a supply chain network is a challenging problem, especially for large networks where there are multiple objectives. Such problems are usually formulated as mixed integer programs. Solving this type of network design problem takes a long time using exact algorithms and for large-scale problems it is not even possible. This has given rise to the use of meta-heuristic techniques. In this paper, an effective tabu search algorithm for solving multi-product, multi-objective, multi-stage supply chain design problems is proposed. The desirable characteristics of the algorithm are developed, coded and tested. The results of the developed algorithm are compared with the results obtained by an improved augmented epsilon-constraint algorithm embedded in the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) software for small-scale, medium-scale, and large-scale instances of multi-objective supply chain problems. Experimental results have shown that the developed algorithm is capable of obtaining high quality solutions within a short computation time, in addition to performing well in other measures such as solution diversity.

For the first time, four environmental factors (the accumulation of dust, water droplets, birds' droppings, and partial shading conditions) affecting system performance are investigated, simultaneously, in one study. The results obtained from this investigation demonstrate that the accumulation of dust, shading, and bird fouling has a significant effect on PV current and voltage, and consequently, the harvested PV energy. 'Shading' had the strongest influence on the efficiency of the PV modules. It was found that increasing the area of shading on a PV module surface by a quarter, half, and three quarters resulted in a power reduction of 33.7%, 45.1%, and 92.6%, respectively. However, results pertaining to the impact of water droplets on the PV panel had an inverse effect, decreasing the temperature of the PV panel, which led to an increase in the potential difference and improved the power output by at least 5.6%. Moreover, dust accumulation reduced the power output by 8.80% and the efficiency by 11.86%, while birds fouling the PV module surface was found to reduce the PV system performance by about 7.4%.|| This study proposes a new multilevel control of a quadrotor with dynamic uncertainties and time-varying external disturbances. The quadrotor model is partitioned into three subsystems: the vertical position, the horizontal position and the rotational subsystems. First, a double loop integral fast terminal sliding mode control with an adaptive estimator for disturbances' upper-bounds (ADIFTSMC) is proposed for the altitude subsystem to ensure that the quadrotor reaches the desired height. Secondly, a radial basis function neural network backstepping controller (RBFNNBC) is applied to the horizontal subsystem. Finally, by combining a finite time exact disturbance observer with backstepping nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode control (FDOBNFTSMC), the rotational angles converge to the reference angles in the presence of the time-varying disturbances. Furthermore, a Lyapunov stability analysis is used to prove that the tracking errors converge to a small neighborhood of the origin. Numerical simulations illustrate the feasibility of the compound control structure.|| This paper presents a recent metaheuristic optimization approach of multi-verse optimizer (MVO) to design load frequency control (LFC) based model predictive control (MPC) incorporated in large multi-interconnected system. The constructed system comprises six plants with renewable energy sources (RESs). MVO is employed to determine the optimal parameters of MPC-LFC to achieve the desired output of the interconnected system in case of load disturbances. The presented system comprises reheat thermal, hydro, photovoltaic (PV) model with maximum power point tracker (MPPT), wind turbine (WT), diesel generation (DG), and superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES). The integral time absolute error (ITAE) of the frequencies and tie-line powers deviations is proposed as objective function. The effects of governor dead zone and generation rate constraint (GRC) of thermal plants are considered. The performance of the proposed MPC optimized via MVO is compared with the other designed via intelligent water drops (IWD) and genetic algorithm (GA). Additionally, the robustness of the proposed MPC-LFC based MVO with variation of the system parameters is presented. The obtained results confirmed the superiority and reliability of the proposed controller compared to the others.|| This article presents a two-stage workforce scheduling approach for security guards at motor traffic gates. In the first stage, staffing requirements are determined based on analyzing workload variations for each gate. In the second stage, an integer programming model is formulated to assign guards to different work shifts in order to satisfy the staffing requirements of each gate. The objective is to minimize the total labour cost of two categories of security employees: non-supervising (guards), and supervising (supervisors). The new model considers multiple employee types, multiple shifts, and multiple locations, where security employees are assigned to work groups. Moreover, to maximize flexibility, each employee can be assigned to work at different gates during different shifts. Compared to the currently used schedule, the model produced an optimum work schedule that reduced the workforce size by 23% and the labour cost by 26%. Computational experiments with 40 randomly generated test problems confirmed the high savings potential of the proposed scheduling approach.|| This research work aims to provide detailed feasibility, a techno-economic evaluation, and energy management of stand-alone hybrid photovoltaic-diesel-battery (PV/DG/B) system. The proposed system can be applied to supply a specific load that is far away from the utility grid (UG) connection, and it is located in Minya city, Egypt, as a real case study. The daily required desalinated water is 250 m(3). The total brackish water demands are 350 & x2013;500 m(3) and 250 & x2013;300 m(3) of water in summer and winter seasons, respectively. Two different sizes of reverse osmosis (RO) units; RO-250 and RO-500, two energy control dispatch strategies; load following (LF) and cycle charging (CC); two sizes of DG; 5 kW and 10 kW are considered in the case study. The cost of energy, renewable fraction, environmental impact, and breakeven grid extension distance are the main criteria that have been considered to determine the optimal size of PV/DG/B to supply the load demand. HOMER & x00AE; software is used to perform the simulation and optimization. For this case study, the minimum cost of energy and the minimum total present cost are 0.074 & x0024;/kWh and 207676 & x0024;, respectively. This is achieved by using a RO-500 unit and a LF dispatch control strategy. The related sizes to the best option of PV/DG/B are 120 kW PV array, 10 kW DG, 64 batteries, and 50 kW converter. A comparison with grid extension and installing stand-alone diesel generation is also carried out. The results of comparison have confirmed that the grid connection is better than all considered options using the RO-250 unit. However, for the RO-500 unit, all options of hybrid PV/DG/B are more economically feasible compared with grid connection, and the best cost-effective option is the one including LF strategy with 10 kW DG. Stand-alone diesel generator produces 119110 kg/year and 117677 kg/year of CO<sub>2</sub> respectively for RO-250 and RO-500.|| This paper addresses a set of multiagent, unmanned, aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a mission within a threat-prone environment. Each UAV is considered as a nonholonomic, nonlinear model moving in a two dimensional space. The system is composed of a fleet of UAVs, competing UAVs and a target. The approach proposed in this paper is based on a biological model representing collective behavior in predator-prey systems. The fleet of UAV& x2019;s (prey) is moving cohesively towards a target and they can come under attack from competing UAV& x2019;s (predators) which are also expected to avoid a certain area around the target, treating it as an obstacle that they have to avoid. Prey and predators are expected to obey certain social behaviors within their respective species that include coherent motion, separation to avoid collision, and alignment. The prey are also connected through an adaptable network. During attacks, this networked population of prey could be divided into several small groups that are still connected and naturally observe the same social behavior. To identify these groups and their members, the density-based algorithm DBSCAN is used. The aim of this work is to use this biologically inspired model along with a robust feedback linearization controller to achieve both target pursuance and effective evasion from two predators. Simulation results demonstrate the different aspects and features provided in the proposed approach.|| Over the past 20 years, integrated decision making for production systems has gained the interest of researchers and practitioners. Many studies have shown that integrated decision making can lead to substantial amount of savings. Yet, a few research work has been conducted on the areas of integrated maintenance, production and quality in dynamic environments. This paper provides an integrated multi-period, maintenance, production and quality-inspection scheduling model, which is formulated as a Markov decision process. The model minimizes the total expected maintenance, production and quality inspection costs. The structural properties of the proposed model are mathematically investigated and with using sensitivity analysis, practical insights are also provided. We mathematically provide conditions to guarantee that the optimal inspection policy is monotone non-decreasing in the state of the machine. Furthermore, we show that the optimal production policy decreases by one unit as the state of inventory increases by one unit. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the production parameters affect both, maintenance and inspection decisions. In addition, the maintenance parameters affect inspection decisions. Finally, it is found that among the inspection parameters (i.e., cost-of-inspection and inspection-errors), type-II error mainly affects maintenance decisions.|| In this paper formation control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle System (UAVs) is introduced. L-1 controller with potential field technique and Data Distribution Service (DDS) middleware used for the navigation of the agents, which is multi-UAVs. L1 adaptive controller used to stabilizing the general equations of motion of each UAVs and the potential field technique used to formalize the followers around the leader. The exchanging data between the leader and the followers done through publisher/subscriber DDS middleware. This L-1 controller has a high performance coming from a robust adaptation of it. Robustness of the L-1 controller verified using Matlab Simulation. The Lyapunov method provided the analysis and stability of the framework of UAVs.|| In this paper, we present a robust, model-predictive control scheme for the general class of uncertain and constrained discrete-time nonlinear systems subject to noisy measurements. The relationships between the system's dynamics, uncertainties, disturbances and the measurement noise are nonlinear and not necessarily additive. In particular, the disturbance is the output of an uncertain system with an unknown input. This study serves the threefold ultimate objective of ensuring robust satisfaction of the state constraints, recursive feasibility and stability. To satisfy state constraints, the proposed algorithms adopt a constraints tightening approach using the restricted constraint sets computed online. Several bounds on the prediction level and rate are derived and the size of the terminal region is maximized using polytopic linear differential inclusions (PLDI). An explicit bound on the maximum allowable disturbance for recursive feasibility is also derived based on optimization of the one-step ahead controllable set to the terminal region. The disturbance and uncertainties are non-vanishing and therefore only Input-to-state practical stability (ISpS) can be ensured. A simulation example demonstrates the efficacy of the mathematical framework and algorithms developed in this work.|| This paper addresses an infinite horizon distributed H-2/H-infinity filtering for discrete-time systems under conditions of bounded power and white stochastic signals. The filter algorithm is designed by computing a pair of gains namely the estimator and the coupling. Herein, we implement a filter to estimate unknown parameters such that the closed-loop multi-sensor accomplishes the desired performances of the proposed H-2/H-infinity schemes over a finite horizon. A switched strategy is implemented to switch between the states once the operation conditions have changed due to disturbances. It is shown that the stability of the overall filtering-error system with H-2/H-infinity performance can be established if a piecewise-quadratic Lyapunov function is properly constructed. A simulation example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.|| In this study, a simulation-based coyote optimization algorithm (COA) to identify the gains of PI to ameliorate the water-pumping system performance fed from the photovoltaic system is presented. The aim is to develop a stand-alone water-pumping system powered by solar energy, i.e., without the need of electric power from the utility grid. The voltage of the DC bus was adopted as a good candidate to guarantee the extraction of the maximum power under partial shading conditions. In such a system, two proportional-integral (PI) controllers, at least, are necessary. The adjustment of (Proportional-Integral) controllers are always carried out by classical and tiresome trials and errors techniques which becomes a hard task and time-consuming. In order to overcome this problem, an optimization problem was reformulated and modeled under functional time-domain constraints, aiming at tuning these decision variables. For achieving the desired operational characteristics of the PV water-pumping system for both rotor speed and DC-link voltage, simultaneously, the proposed COA algorithm is adopted. It is carried out through resolving a multiobjective optimization problem employing the weighted-sum technique. Inspired on theCanis latransspecies, the COA algorithm is successfully investigated to resolve such a problem by taking into account some constraints in terms of time-domain performance as well as producing the maximum power from the photovoltaic generation system. To assess the efficiency of the suggested COA method, the classical Ziegler-Nichols and trial-error tuning methods for the DC-link voltage and rotor speed dynamics, were compared. The main outcomes ensured the effectiveness and superiority of the COA algorithm. Compared to the other reported techniques, it is superior in terms of convergence rapidity and solution qualities.|| We focus on the aggregation of distributed energy resources (DERs) through a profit-maximizing intermediary that enables participation of DERs in wholesale electricity markets. Particularly, we study the market efficiency brought in by the large-scale deployment of DERs and explore to what extent such benefits are offset by the profit-maximizing nature of the aggregator. We deploy a game-theoretic framework to study the strategic interactions between an agreggator and DER owners. The proposed model takes into account the stochastic nature of the DER supply. We explicitly characterize the equilibrium of the game and provide illustrative examples to quantify the efficiency loss due to the strategic incentives of the aggregator. Our numerical experiments illustrate the impact of uncertainty and amount of DER integration on the overall market efficiency.|| The productivity of the capacitive deionization (CDI) system is enhanced by determining the optimum operational and structural parameters using radial movement optimization (RMO) algorithm. Six different parameters, i.e., pool water concentration, freshwater recovery, salt ion adsorption, lowest concentration point, volumetric (based on the volume of deionized water), and gravimetric (based on salt removed) energy consumptions are used to evaluate the performance of the CDI process. During the optimization process, the decision variables are represented by the applied voltage, capacitance, flow rate, spacer volume, and cell volume. Two different optimization techniques are considered: single-objective and multi-objective functions. The obtained results by RMO optimizer are compared with those obtained using a genetic algorithm (GA). The results demonstrated that the RMO optimization technique is useful in exploring all possibilities and finding the optimum conditions for operating the CDI unit in a faster and accurate method.|| In this paper, we present a robust containment control design for multi Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Systems (UAVs) based on the Data Distribution Service (DDS) middleware and L-1 adaptive controller. The Data Distribution Service middleware, L-1 adaptive controller and graph theory technique are utilized for the navigation of the UAVs. The L-1 controller is utilized as a local controller for each UAVs and the graph theory approach is utilized to constitute the followers inside their leaders. Finally, the DDS Middleware is used to exchange data between the followers and their leaders. Robust adaptation of the L-1 controller makes the system robust with a high level of performance. Matlab simulation verified the robustness of the L-1 controller. We provide stability proofs using Lyapunov analysis for the UAVs framework.|| This work presents performance study of a concentrating photovoltaic/thermal (CPV/T) collector and its efficiency to produce electric and thermal power under different operating conditions. The study covers a detailed description of flat photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) and CPV/T systems using water as a cooling working fluid, numerical model analysis, and qualitative evaluation of thermal and electrical output. The aim of this study was to achieve higher efficiency of the photovoltaic (PV) system while reducing the cost of generating power. Concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) cells with low-cost reflectors were used to enhance the efficiency of the PV system and simultaneously reduce the cost of electricity generation. For this purpose, a linear Fresnel flat mirror (LFFM) integrated with a PV system was used for low-concentration PV cells (LCPV). To achieve the maximum benefit, water as a coolant fluid was used to study the ability of actively cooling PV cells, since the electrical power of the CPV system is significantly affected by the temperature of the PV cells. This system was characterized over the traditional PV systems via producing more electrical energy due to concentrating the solar radiation as well as cooling the PV modules and at the same time producing thermal energy that can be used in domestic applications. During the analysis of the results of the proposed system, it was found that the maximum electrical and thermal energy obtained were 170 W and 580 W, respectively, under solar concentration ratio 3 and the flow rate of the cooling water 1 kg/min. A good agreement between the theoretical and experimental results was confirmed.|| In this paper, we propose a novel closed loop supply chain design with multiple periods, echelons and uncertainties.

Aging for up to 1000 h at 600-1000 degrees C is found to have no marked effect on both room-temperature and elevated-temperature tensile strength.|| A comparison of the thermal performance and energy efficiency of walls constructed using autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) block with thermal insulating plaster and reflective coating and the standard hollow-core concrete block (HCB) wall is presented. The study was performed through the field monitoring of two test rooms with AAC and HCB walls located in Eastern Saudi Arabia, with weather characterized by a hot and humid climate during the summer. Weather stations, infrared cameras, thermocouples, heat flux meters, temperature/relative humidity sensors, U-value equipment, and power meters were used to assess the thermal performance and energy consumption of the two test rooms. The results indicated that the thermal resistance of AAC walls was about five times that of the HCB walls, whereas the thermal transmittance of AAC walls was reduced by 82%. The AAC blocks with insulating plaster and reflective coating tendered a 58% reduction in the energy consumption in the AAC wall test room. Simulation of the test rooms using DesignBuilder software version 5.4 captured the field results with reasonable accuracy.|| Isothermal oxidation tests at 1150 degrees C show that the commercial grade of the single-crystal Ni-based superalloy CMSX-4 is superior to that of the CMSX-10 version. Superalloy CMSX-4 is observed to undergo a shorter stage of transient oxidation and to be able to form more protective oxides during the earlier stages of the reaction as compared to superalloy CMSX-10. This behavior is correlated with the difference in chemical composition between the two superalloys. A significant improvement in oxidation resistance of both superalloys is realized after diffusing a 10 mu m thick layer of Pt into their surfaces to produce a Pt-rich surface layer of gamma '-phase. However, the oxidation resistance of the composite Pt/CMSX-10 system becomes superior to that of the Pt/CMSX-4 system. Most evidence indicates that this is a reflection of the higher microstructural stability of the gamma '-phase in superalloy CMSX-10 and the added beneficial effect provided by Pt.|| This study proposes durable concrete mix design suitable for use in superstructures of an industrial plant of a cement company located in an area marked by heavy industrial pollution. Concentration of pollutants in the environment was recorded by undertaking ambient air quality monitoring along with an assessment of corrosivity of soil and ground water present at the site. Type of reinforcement, concreting procedures and protection methods were determined for reinforced concrete that was intended to be used in conjunction with steel structures. Experimental results indicated that soil and groundwater constituted no risk for the substructure. However, air was highly polluted and deemed to be severely corrosive due to the presence of chloride and sulfate salts, SO2 and CO2 in concentrations recorded several times higher than at a comparable industrial area. A concrete mix design suitable for observed conditions was recommended. Additionally, it was suggested that concrete reinforced with black steel bars should be completely coated while that using FBE coated steel bars should be coated up to a height of 1.5m from the grade level for protection against ingress of salt and water.|| This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the potential and feasibility of using solar thermal cooling systems in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The performance of a desiccant cooling system has been determined based on climatic data of 32 cities spread all over the territory of the country. The investigation has been carried out keeping in view the high energy consumption for cooling applications in the country. The analysis has been done using the overall performance of the system, sensible energy ratio, and cooling and regeneration loads. The main objective of this study is to encourage the implementation of solar thermal cooling systems in the country for the development of sustainable buildings. The economic analysis shows that thermal cooling technology can reduce the cost of cooling units, remarkably. Furthermore, the utilization of the proposed system will decrease the dependence on primary energy resources. The saving factor of the proposed system with 1 ton capacity in comparison to the conventional vapor compression unit is found to be 34.6%. The present study also recommends that the government subsidies and incentives can further improve the development and utilization of solar air conditioning technology in developing countries.|| Concrete water tanks have a stringent serviceability requirement in terms of limiting crack widths. Excessive cracks or cracks running across the full depth of these tanks could result in loss of serviceability from leakage and affect their integrity. This scenario is particularly true for liquid retaining structures, such as water tanks. In this paper, following a field inspection that revealed considerable cracking in the walls of a water tank constructed in the arid Arabian Gulf environment, a diagnostic investigation was carried out on the water tank, which was 30 x 20 m in plan and 3.6 m in height. Field inspection and assessment, laboratory investigation, and a three-dimensional (3D) finite element simulation of the water tank structure was carried out to investigate the causes of the cracking. A repair strategy was implemented, and its performance was assessed. The heat of hydration characteristics of the concrete mix used was obtained using a semi adiabatic calorimeter. The heat of hydration, free shrinkage strain, mechanical properties of the concrete, and the ambient conditions at the time of construction were used in a three-dimensional (3D) finite element simulation model. Tensile stresses resulting from restrained temperature and shrinkage strains exceeded the tensile stress capacity, resulting in cracks in the tank walls. A repair strategy was proposed and implemented to restore the functionality of the tank. Based on the diagnostic methodology proposed in this paper, guidelines have been suggested that address the mitigation of the risk of cracking attributable to thermal and shrinkage stresses in the harsh and arid environment in the Arabian Gulf.

It was noted that AAB without nSiO(2) was relatively porous with the presence of micro-, meso- and macro-level pores. In contrast, as the proportion of nSiO(2) increased in the mixture, the pore structure started to refine with a reduction in the pore volume due to transformation of source material to polymeric compound, such as C-A-S-H with a higher Al absorption in the binder structure. The incorporation of 5% and 7.5% nSiO(2) resulted in the refinement of the pore structure due to enhanced polycondensation. Consequently, there was considerable improvement in the mechanical properties. The experimental data indicated that the pore structure evaluation through NMR has served as a tool to understand the relation between the micro- and macro-level performance of the developed AAC.|| A manifold pipe made of the wrought Incoloy 800H and handling gaseous hydrocarbons at 820 degrees C has developed longitudinal cracks leading to unscheduled plant shutdown short of about 17% of the expected service life. The respective hydrocarbons result from steam reforming of methane to produce hydrogen in a series of furnace tubes attached to the pipe and externally heated by outside burners. It is shown that the cracks are of intergranular nature and have resulted from massive precipitation of grain boundary carbides particularly the extremely hard and brittle M7C3-type. This is correlated with substantial absorption of elemental carbon released by chemical reactions among carbonaceous gases and subjecting the pipe to carburization attack. However, the role of possible higher than normal external firing temperature in accelerating the carburization and creep rates could not be ruled out. This can occur to compensate for the insulating effect of coke deposited at the inner surface.|| This article investigates the technical performance of 230 kV field-aged composite insulators in the coastal region of Saudi Arabia. Two insulator samples removed from the 230 kV line after 20 years of service are assessed at KFUPM High Voltage Lab (KHVL). Different assessment techniques, such as visual inspection, contact angle, surface pollution severity, electrical withstand, and material characterization are utilized to evaluate the insulator performance. Equivalent salt deposit density (ESDD) and non-soluble deposit density (NSDD) techniques are used for the surface pollution severity measurements. Clear views of surface changes and surface hydrophobicity conditions are displayed. Scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry (EDX), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-IR) techniques are utilized for the material characterization. The visual inspection reveals small and big cracks in the insulator sheds. Hard breakable portion areas, many shed cuts, changed color areas, and whitish parts are visually noticed in the insulator surface. Such changes confirm the aging condition effect of the insulator units. Furthermore, the samples are subjected to laboratory clean fog tests to check the electrical performance of the samples. Informative results are given for the current condition and performance for the 20-years, field-aged insulators. Additionally, the experimental results are presented for the rest of the insulator life period. Utilization of the existing line insulators has been evaluated. Finally, discussions and recommendations for the future handling of the insulators at the 230 kV line are highlighted.|| Hybrid power systems are technically suitable for providing continuous and quality power to remotely located dwellings and have the potential of reducing the greenhouse gases emissions. The present study aims at finding an optimal hybrid power system based on wind, solar, diesel, and battery backup, which can address the load requirements of a village (Muhavoor, India). The present study utilizes the HOMER software for sizing the major power components, performing economic analysis and estimating greenhouse gas emission. It uses the minimum cost of energy as the basis for optimum system selection. Local load, wind speed, and solar radiation data along with technical and financial input of wind turbines, solar photovoltaic panels, diesel generators, inverters, and fuel are considered in the simulation. Several options have been considered in the study including: diesel, PV/diesel/battery, wind/diesel, and PV/wind/diesel/battery hybrid power systems. Based on the simulation results and analysis, the PV/diesel/battery system with 53MW capacity of PV, 16.55MW diesel generator capacity, 3,520MWh of battery backup, and 15.5MW of converter is recommended as the best option for the concerned village. This system is capable of meeting the entire load of the village with annual energy yield of 92,549MWh with an excess energy of 7,262MWh. Of the total electricity produced, PV panels generate 92.71% with a renewable fraction of 89.2% at an energy cost of 0.117US$/kWh. The total cost of the proposed hybrid power system can be recovered in 11 or 8 years with positive cash flows at the end of year 12 or 9 based on sale of electricity alone or with additional income from fuel savings and greenhouse gases credit incentive.|| Stator inter-turn fault diagnosis system for electric motors is of a considerable concern due to its significant effect on industrial production. In this paper, a new method for detecting the inter-turn fault and quantifying its severity in the line start permanent magnet synchronous motor (LSMPSM) is proposed. The new method depends on monitoring the stator current during steady-state period to detect the fault. The convolutional neural network (CNN) method is proposed to correlate the motor steady-state current with the status of the motor winding conditions and detect any presence of inter-turn faults. The data used in this study is extracted from both an experimental setup of a one-horsepower LSPMSM and the corresponding verified mathematical model through several testing cases under various loading conditions. One of the main features of the proposed technique is that it does not require separate feature extraction phase. The results indicate that the proposed technique is able to detect the inter-turn fault under different loading conditions varies from 0NM to 4NM with accuracy of 97.75 & x0025; for all defined fault levels. The use of steady-state current for fault detection regardless of motor load enables the proposed technique to detect the fault online without disturbing the system functionality and reliability as well as without adding any extra hardware to the system.|| This study provides an overview of the common modes and causes of failure of heat exchanger tubes. Failure investigations of heat exchangers reported in the literature are compiled in this review based on the mechanisms of failure. A large majority of heat exchanger components fail by way of fatigue, creep, corrosion, oxidation, and hydrogen attack. Most common causes of failure include fouling, scaling, salt deposition, weld defects, and vibration. Effective recommendations to prevent such failures form an important part of this study. It is suggested that suitable materials selection, appropriate tubes design, effective control of the constitution of the working fluid and operating conditions and use of skilled workforce can prolong service lifetime of heat exchangers. Corrosion-related failures of heat exchangers are presented in a related article (Part II).|| This paper presents an experimental study on the physicochemical properties of rice oil, peanut oil, corn oil and Kraft paper immersed in these oils in the presence of antioxidants (butylated hydroxytoluene, tertiary butyl hydroquinone and Naugalube over bar 750). The experiments are performed on new and aged conditions. Ageing of oils is carried at 115 degrees C for 96 hours while Kraft paper is aged in oils at 130 degrees C for 164 hours. Both closed and open cup methods are used for ageing. The results show that ageing insignificantly affects the breakdown voltage, but markedly increases the acid number and the viscosity of the vegetable oils. The combination of tertiary butyl hydroquinone and either butylated hydroxytoluene or Naugalube over bar 750 slightly increases the breakdown voltage, but significantly raises the oxidation stability of the vegetable oils. This results in a reduction in the viscosity and the acid number of the vegetable oils. Moisture significantly affects the breakdown voltage of both vegetable and mineral oil. High moisture content results in low breakdown voltage. The results also show that ageing insignificantly affects the breakdown voltage, but markedly decreases the tensile strength of oil-impregnated paper. Although the presence of antioxidants does not increase the breakdown voltage of aged paper, these additives slow down the ageing process. This results in an increase in tensile strength of the paper.|| This study focuses on the development of durable structural lightweight concrete(LWC) by incorporating expanded perlite aggregate (EPA) in the range of 0 to 20% by weight. In order to ensure its durability when exposed to chloride environment, concrete was produced with low water-to-cement ratio and ordinary Portland cement (OPC) was replaced with 50% and 7% ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) and silica fume (SF), respectively. The mechanical properties and durability of concrete were assessed by determining the unit weight, compressive strength, flexural strength, drying shrinkage, chloride permeability and migration, as well as resistance of concrete to corrosion of reinforcing steel. Very importantly, thermal insulation properties were determined using a hot guarded plate. In addition, a finite element model (FEM) was prepared to study the behavior of EPA-modified concrete under seismic loading. The results showed that the unit weight of concrete was reduced by 20% to 30% when compared with the normal weight concrete (NWC). The compressive strength of the developed LWC was sufficient to be used as structural concrete, particularly of those mixtures containing 10% and 15% perlite aggregate. The durability of LWC was comparable to NWC in terms of chloride diffusion and resistance of concrete to corrosion of reinforcing steel. The tangible outcomes also include the superior thermal insulation properties of LWC compared to NWC. The greater incorporation of EPA in the concrete resulted in better behavior under seismic loading.|| Textile dye industry is known to release large amounts of undesirable effluents into industrial wastewater resulting in severe contamination. In this study, novel nanostructured materials were synthesized to treat such polluted water. Transition metals (e.g., vanadium-V, niobium-Nb, and tantalum-Ta) were incorporated individually into tellurium (Te) by adopting the solid-state technique. The compounds were synthesized with fixed dopant-to-host stoichiometric ratios (V:Te, Nb:Te, Ta:Te) while various characterization techniques were used to compare the characteristics of the synthesized products. Specifically, dye aqueous solution degraded with NaBH(4)in the presence of tellurites of transition metal oxides acting as catalyst was studied. XRD analysis confirmed the formation of orthorhombic phase compounds in V and Ta and monoclinic compounds within Nb. Full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) data were extracted from the most intense peak in the XRD spectrum to measure the crystallite size using the Debye-Scherrer method. FESEM was used to investigate the surface morphology of the prepared compounds, which showed agglomerated particles that possessed an irregular shape. HR-TEM was employed to gain a detailed insight into the material's crystal structure. Optical properties, functional group and chemical composition were recorded using UV-Vis, FTIR spectroscopy and EDS analysis, respectively. Raman spectroscopy was carried out to confirm the stretching vibrations and modes of the synthesized products. Thermal stability of the compounds was confirmed at high temperature with DSC/TGA. Moreover, the antimicrobial activity of these binary systems was tested againstEscherichia coli(gram-ive) andStaphylococcus aureus(gram + ive) bacterial strains. It was observed that bactericidal potential was the highest at maximum concentrations of the dopant.|| In the reported study, the performance of some generic and proprietary inhibitors in inhibiting corrosion of reinforcing steel in cracked and uncracked silica fume cement concrete beams was evaluated. Two types of concrete beams, uncracked and cracked, were prepared according to ASTM G109 and they were exposed to wetting and drying cycles of salty water. The performance of the selected inhibitors in decreasing reinforcement corrosion in the concrete beams was monitored by measuring the micro-cell current and corrosion potentials. Furthermore, the top bars in the beams were removed and visually inspected to note the type and extent of corrosion. All the selected corrosion inhibitors performed well in the uncracked concrete beams. The overall cost per year for uncracked beams incorporating the selected inhibitors decreased by 2.75 to 4.8 times compared to the control specimens, i.e. without an inhibitor. The calcium nitrite-based inhibitors exhibited the best performance in terms of corrosion protection in the cracked concrete beams. However, other inhibitors, such as generic inhibitor based on calcium nitrite, liquid concrete admixture based on amine carboxylate and liquid concrete admixture based on modified amino alcohol, provided none or at best limited protection to the reinforcing steel. The mechanism of corrosion inhibition of the selected inhibitors is also presented.|| Despite implementing several methodologies including a combination of physical, chemical and biological techniques, aquatic and microbial pollution remains a challenge to this day. Recently, nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention due to their extraordinary prospective for utilization toward environmental remediation. Among several probable candidates, TiO(2)stands out due to its potential for use in multifaceted applications. One way to improve the catalytic and antimicrobial potential of TiO(2)is to dope it with certain elements. In this study, Zr-doped TiO(2)was synthesized through a sol-gel chemical method using various dopant concentrations (2, 4, 6, and 8 wt%). Surface morphological, microstructural and elemental analysis was carried out using FESEM and HR-TEM along with EDS to confirm the formation of Zr-TiO2. XRD spectra showed a linear shift of the (101) anatase peak to lower diffraction angles (from 25.4 degrees to 25.08 degrees) with increasing Zr(4+)concentration. Functional groups were examinedviaFTIR, an ample absorption band appearing between 400 and 700 cm(-1)in the acquired spectrum was attributed to the vibration modes of the Ti-O-Ti linkage present within TiO(2)nanoparticles, which denotes the formation of TiO2. Experimental results indicated that with increasing dopant concentrations, photocatalytic potential was enhanced significantly. In this respect, TiO(2)doped with 8 wt% Zr (sample 0.08 : 1) exhibited outstanding performance by realizing 98% elimination of synthetic MB in 100 minutes. This is thought to be due to a decreased rate of electron-hole pair recombination that transpires upon doping. Therefore, it is proposed that Zr-doped TiO(2)can be used as an effective photocatalyst material for various environmental and wastewater treatment applications. The good docking scores and binding confirmation of Zr-doped TiO(2)suggested doped nanoparticles as a potential inhibitor against selected targets of bothE. coliandS. aureus. Hence, enzyme inhibition studies of Zr-doped TiO(2)NPs are suggested for further confirmation of thesein silicopredictions.|| This paper presents a novel stator inter-turn fault diagnosis method for Line Start Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (LSPMSMs) using the frequency analysis of acoustic signals resulting from asymmetrical faults. In this method, acoustic data are experimentally collected from a 1 hp interior mount LSPMSM for different inter-turn fault cases and motor loading levels, while including the background noise. The signals are collected using a smartphone at a sampling rate of 48,000 samples per second. The signal for each case is analyzed using fast Fourier transform (FFT), which results in the decomposition of the signal into its frequency components. The results indicate that, for both no-load and full-load conditions, 39 components are observed to be affected by the faults, whereby their amplitudes increase with the fault severity. The 40-turns fault shows the highest difference in the component amplitudes compared with the healthy condition acoustic signal. Therefore, this diagnostic method is able to detect the stator inter-turn fault for interior mount LSPMSMs. Moreover, the method is simple and cheap since it uses a readily available sensor.|| Engineered cementitious composites (ECCs) possessing strain-hardening behavior have been developed utilizing supplementary cementitious materials and fibers. The developed ECCs exhibit excellent performance in terms of mechanical and thermal properties and are highly durable. However, the latest trend is to use industrial waste materials (IWMs), as alkali-activated materials, in the development of ECCs. In this paper, a state-of-the-art review on the development of sustainable-ECCs utilizing IWMs is presented. The formulations of binders and fibers, used in the production of ECCs, are described. The effect of mixture composition on the mechanical properties, such as compressive and tensile strength, and durability of ECCs is discussed. In addition, the importance of micromechanics modeling for producing a strain-hardened ECC is presented. Further, the engineering applications of ECCs in structural and repair fields are discussed along with suggestions for future research.|| Distributed generation (DG) units are utilized to feed their closed loads in the autonomous microgrid. While in the grid-connected microgrid, they are integrated to support the utility by their required real and reactive powers. To achieve this goal, these integrated DGs must be controlled well. In this paper, an optimal PQ control scheme is proposed to control and share a predefined injected real and reactive powers of the inverter based DGs. The control problem is optimally designed and investigated to search for the optimal controller parameters by minimizing the error between the reference and calculated powers using particle swarm optimization (PSO). Microgrid containing inverter-based DG, PLL, coupling inductance, LC filter, power and current controllers is implemented on MATLAB. Two microgrid cases with different structure are studied and discussed. In both cases, the microgrid performance is investigated under different disturbances such as three-phase fault and step changes. The simulation results show that the proposed optimal control improves the microgrid dynamic stability. Additionally, the considered microgrids are implemented on real time digital simulator (RTDS). The experimental results verify the effectiveness and tracking capability of the proposed controllers and show close agreement with the simulation results. Finally, the comparison with the literature confirms the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.|| Close-packed superlattice derivatives of the face-centered cubic (fcc) structure with Ni3X-type composition in some commercial Ni-based superalloys have been characterized, and their effect on tensile strength has been determined. Both the L1(2) and DO22 superlattices can form directly from the fcc structure by minor atoms rearrangement. However, the two superlattices can act as transient metastable phases which transform into more stable superlattices (L1(2) -> DO24 and DO22 -> D0(a)) with extended thermal exposure at elevated temperatures. It is shown that the stability and morphology of each superlattice are dependent upon the alloy composition. Although some superlattices produce adverse effects on tensile strength, others are found to have beneficial effects. The exact effect is correlated with the particular morphology and deformation mode. It is concluded that the DO22 superlattice can form the basis for designing alloys deformable by twinning and combine high strength and high ductility.|| Type 304 stainless steel has been used to manufacture metal gaskets used as seals in bolted flange joints of hydrocarbon transfer pipeline in polyethylene plant and piping system used to distribute demineralized water in a polypropylene plant. During reassembling of ten joints after scheduled maintenance, heavy leakage has occurred in one joint. On the other hand, the water pipes have been drained and unused for about 2 months; however, after reuse, leakage has been detected. It is shown that the gasket has been crushed due to improper reassembling practice involving the application of excessive compressive preload generated by tightening the bolts. Most evidence pointed out that the water pipes have been degraded by pitting corrosion due to contamination of the water by chloride ions.|| The solar thermal performance of a 102 kW rated thermal capacity linear Fresnel reflector system was evaluated experimentally under fixed and variable airflow rate through the oil-air heat exchanger. The solar thermal system consisted of 240 mirrors (linear Fresnel solar reflectors), each of 1485 by 625 mm size to heat the thermal oil, which was used to heat the air using the oil to air heat exchanger (AFfE). The results show that the actual maximum efficiency of the solar collector lies in the range of 0.28 to 0.34, whereas the calculated one is about 0.54 for the variable airflow rates. However, for a fixed airflow rate, the actual maximum efficiency is between 0.26 and 0.30. It implies that the actual solar collector efficiency is much lower than the calculated values. One of the major factors, which is not accounted for in the theoretical efficiency calculation, is the effect of dust on the primary and secondary mirrors. The investigated site is observing considerable sand movement, which is affecting the thermal output of the solar collector. The maximum heat exchanger effectiveness, e, obtained for variable and fixed airflow conditions is 0.9 and 0.8, respectively.|| Platinum is diffused into the single-crystal superalloys CMSX-4 and CMSX-10 to integrate a surface protection layer consisting of a mixture of gamma '- and gamma-phases. It is shown that the Pt/CMSX-10 system is characterized by higher thermal stability and resistance to oxidation in comparison with the Pt/CMSX-4 system. Such difference is correlated with the initial microstructure and composition of the two systems and is reflected on their performance in thermal barrier coatings utilizing yttria-stabilized zirconia as top coating. Based upon cyclic oxidation tests, the Pt/CMSX-10 system is found to provide about threefold increase in useful life. However, both coatings are found to fail by spallation of the top coating due to decohesion of the thermally grown oxide developed by each system. It is concluded that the higher performance provided by the Pt/CMSX-10 stems from decelerated kinetics of interdiffusion and oxidation.|| A network of three copper piping systems has been used to distribute cold, warm and hot waters to a healthcare complex. The pipes have been hard-drawn using phosphorus-oxidized copper grade. However, water leakage from the three pipes has been detected after less than 2years in service. It is shown that the three pipes have been degraded by pitting corrosion due to the relatively high sulfate-to-chloride ratio in the water. The corrosion product formed at the inner surface of each pipe is found to consist of an outermost discontinuous and non-protective layer of copper oxide followed by an intermediate chloride layer, and an inner sulfate layer forming the major component. It is concluded that the most probable cause of failure is sulfur contamination of water at the source.|| Naturally formed oxide film on the surface of aluminum reduces corrosion rate to significant extent. Anodizing of aluminum is done to enhance this feature by increasing film thickness deliberately to desired level. In the current work, anodizing of Al-2024 alloy was carried out in sulfuric-acetic acid anodizing bath of different concentrations along with gradually increased applied potential. The structure and morphology of the developed anodized film was investigated with and without the addition of acetic acid. Structural and surface analysis results revealed the difference in the anodized layer formation with the presence of acetic acid in sulfuric acid bath. Electrochemical investigation was carried out to evaluate the surface protective performance of the formed anodized film in 3.5% NaCl solution. Potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) revealed that lowest corrosion rate with highest polarization resistance was achieved due to the presence of CH3COOH in the anodizing bath. Non-adsorptive and less porous anodized film noticed to be formed with the presence of CH3COOH in bath solution.|| Supercritical water is uniquely a green medium for diverse applications because of its changing nature from polar to non-polar. Owing to this property, it is being considered for heavy oil upgradation since it dissolves both organics (oil) and hydrogen while inorganics behave conversely. However, because of the high pressure and temperature (22.1MPa, 374 degrees C), corrosive environment (chlorides, sulfides and salt deposition) and stresses involved, there are serious concerns encountered ","|| On the tensile strength of medium entropy Fe30Ni30Cr20Co17Mo2W1 alloy with high microstructural stability|| Thermal Performance Evaluation of Walls with AAC Blocks, Insulating

The present study attempts to describe the historical changes of trace elements in the sediments of vegetated coastal habitats in the western Arabian Gulf. Pb-210-dated sediment cores collected from seagrass, mangrove and saltmarsh habitats were analyzed to evaluate historical variations in concentrations and burial rates of 20 trace elements (Al, As, Ba, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, P, Pb, S, Sr, V and Zn). The highest correlations (Spearman correlation coefficients >= 0.51) were found between crustal elements (Al, Fe, Co, Cr, K, Na, Mg, Mn, Ni, V, and P), suggesting a common crustal source in the Gulf. The increased concentrations of these crustal elements in modern marine sediments of the Arabian Gulf seem to be linked to increased mineral dust deposition in the area. Over the last century, both elemental concentrations and burial rates increased by factors of 1-9 and 1-15, respectively, with a remarkably fast increase occurring in the past six decades (1960 - early 2000). This is most likely due to an increase in anthropogenic pressures along the Gulf coast. Our study demonstrates that sediments in vegetated coastal habitats provide long-term archives of trace elements concentrations and burial rates reflecting human activities in the Arabian Gulf.

The tremendous characteristics of MXenes i.e., high surface area, activate metallic hydroxide sites, biocompatibility, ease of functionalization, high metallic conductivity and hydrophilicity make them the best aspirant for applications in environmental remediation, energy storage, electronics, sensors, and catalysis. MXenes exhibited substantial sorption selectivity and efficient reduction capability for numerous pollutants present in water. This paper critically reviews the recent advancement in applications of MXenes in water treatment with an emphasis on adsorption-reduction properties of MXenes and MXene-based composites. The removal of selected pollutants i.e., heavy metals, dyes, and radionuclides by MXenes and MXene-based composites are portrayed in detail by elaborating the removal mechanism and regeneration ability. The key challenges and issues associated with the synthesis and applications of MXenes and MXene-based composites in water purification are highlighted. Lastly, research directions are provided to guarantee the synthesis and applications of MXenes in a more effective way. This review may provide an insight into the applications of MXenes for water purification in future.|| In this study, a new magnetic adsorbent, strontium ferrite-bentonite-CoNiAl composite (SF-B-CoNiAl), was synthesized via co-precipitation technique and employed for the adsorptive removal of two anionic dyes, Eriochrome Black T (EBT) and Methyl Orange (MO) from water. The surface functionalities, structure and morphology of the new adsorbent (SF-B-CoNiAl) were evaluated via scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis. The batch experiments indicated that the experimental adsorption capacity of SF-B-CoNiAl was 329.61 and 219.56 mg/g for EBT and MO, respectively. Freundlich isotherm best fitted the experimental data signifying heterogeneous surface with multilayer dyes uptake. The adsorption process of anionic dyes onto SF-B-CoNiAl involves both physisorption and chemisorption. The kinetic data of MO and EBT adsorption by SF-B-CoNiAl were well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The prepared adsorbent exhibited good recyclability that demonstrates their potential for application in water purification.|| Nanoparticles (NPs) are widely employed in different research areas, ranging from analytical chemistry and environmental science to medicine, the agriculture and pharmaceutical industry. This is mainly due to the unique characteristics of NPs and the novelty they introduce in such applications. In analytical chemistry, the role of NPs can differ depending on the nature of the steps involved in analytical process. NPs are probably most useful for detection, but sample preparation has also profited from them. For instance, NPs can advantageously replace conventional sorbents for solid-phase extraction. Moreover, NPs are being increasingly used as stationary phases in gas and liquid chromatography or electrochromatography. In this review, a brief summary on the classification, synthesis methods, and properties of NPs is given. Moreover, the examples of applications in different research area are shortly presented. However, the merits of this work are to present the use of NPs in analytical chemistry field.|| MXenes, novel 2D transition metal carbides, have emerged as wonderful nanomaterials and a superlative contestant for a host of applications. The tremendous characteristics of MXenes, i.e., high surface area, high metallic conductivity, ease of functionalization, biocompatibility, activated metallic hydroxide sites, and hydrophilicity, make them the best aspirant for applications in energy storage, catalysis, sensors, electronics, and environmental remediation. Due to their exceptional physicochemical properties and multifarious chemical compositions, MXenes have gained considerable attention for applications in water treatment and desalination in recent times. It is vital to understand the current status of MXene applications in desalination in order to define the roadmap for the development of MXene-based materials and endorse their practical applications in the future. This paper critically reviews the recent advancement in the synthesis of MXenes and MXene-based composites for applications in desalination. The desalination potential of MXenes is portrayed in detail with a focus on ion-sieving membranes, capacitive deionization, and solar desalination. The ion removal mechanism and regeneration ability of MXenes are also summarized to get insight into the process. The key challenges and issues associated with the synthesis and applications of MXenes and MXene-based composites in desalination are highlighted. Lastly, research directions are provided to guarantee the synthesis and applications of MXenes in a more effective way. This review may provide an insight into the applications of MXenes for water desalination in the future.|| Climate change mitigation in rapidly growing developing countries is receiving increased global attention, especially after the 2016 Paris Agreement. In Bangladesh, the government has initiated some climate change policies to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in the last decade. However, the rate of emissions has been increasing recently, which questions the emissions reduction potential of these policies. Therefore, this study has utilized relevant indicators to evaluate the extent to which the policies are mitigating climate change, and of their synergy with national development goals. The findings indicate that the policies have limited impacts on energy decarbonization, energy demand management, and emissions sink improvement. Although policies on renewable energy, energy efficiency and demand management, and afforestation are aligned with national development goals, the policies on electricity generation from coal and forest biomass have little synergy with the goals. By quantitatively evaluating the effects of its climate change policies in enhancing socioeconomic, and environmental benefits, this study can assist Bangladesh's policymakers to understand the impact of the policies on climate change mitigation and their level of integration with national development goals. Also, other developing countries can adopt the study methodology to evaluate their climate change policies and track their progress. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The MWCNTs were employed for the uptake of tungsten species at pH 6 in batch experiments. It was observed that 100% of tungsten species were removed in 2 h, by employing 75 mg of MWCNTs from the aqueous solution containing 10 ppm of tungsten. Adsorption equilibrium data were fitted by the three isotherm models namely the Langmuir, Freundlich, and Sips isotherms and best described by a three-parameter Sips model. The maximum experimental adsorption capacity of MWCNTs for tungsten was 17.64 mg/g, while the adsorption capacity anticipated by the Langmuir and Sips isotherm models was 20.58 and 25.18 mg/g, respectively. The adsorption kinetic data was adequately fitted by a pseudo-second-order model. Our present findings ascertained that MWCNTs could be a potential adsorbent for the removal of tungsten species from the aqueous phase.|| In arid countries such as Saudi Arabia, aeolian sand often covers a large area of the country. Understanding the variations of sand properties in dunes, including grain size, sorting, mineral composition and water content, can be important for groundwater recharge, environmental, and construction applications. Earlier studies examined properties of sand dunes by collecting samples from the surface. This study aims to investigate variations of sand properties within a Barchan sand dune in the coastal area of Saudi Arabia, by collecting samples and measurements from two vertically drilled boreholes up to the ground water level; one drilled in the dune crest and another one in the limb. Representative samples were collected and analyzed for their texture parameters, water content, and mineralogy. Electrical resistivity survey data was also acquired to map water content variation in the dune limb, and for comparison with well bore data. The reported results show no vertical variations in grain size or sorting in the dune crest. In contrast, the upper 0.5 m of the dune limb shows a relatively poorer sorting than found in deeper parts of the dune. Laterally, no variations in minerology were observed between crest and limb sands while grain size tended to be slightly coarser in the dune limb compared to the crest. Regarding the water content, it was found to vary vertically, probably due to previous cycles of rainfall infiltration through the sand body. Such observed variation in water content is consistent with the measured resistivity profile which could clearly identify the water table and areas with higher water content. This study concludes that beyond the upper 0.5 m, the Barchan sand dune body can be treated as a homogeneous medium in terms of mineralogy and sorting while grain size increases slightly toward the limb side.|| Natural fracture is the main control on production from unconventional shale reservoirs as it serves as a drainage conduit and promotes the efficiency of the hydraulic fracturing technique. The Qusaiba Shale (QS), particularly its basal unit was recently identified as a potential unconventional shale gas reservoir in Saudi Arabia. This study presents a comprehensive and systematic description as well as statistical analysis of the natural fractures that cut through the QS outcrop in the Tabuk Basin, NW Saudi Arabia. These analyses were used to identify the factors that control the development of a fracture system in this organic-rich Shale. Three main approaches including areal sampling, scanline and topology analyses were utilized to collect fracture measurements. A total of 495 fracture traces were measured. The fracture length ranges between 7 cm and 8.2 m. The measured fracture traces are classified into four groups; subvertical to vertical, high-angle, low angle and bedding to subparallel fracture traces. Using twenty-one scan lines, the total number of fracture traces that cut through are 374, with average fracture intensity ranging from 0.9 to 3.7 fracture/meter. Four main fracture sets trending E-W, NE-SW, NW-SE and NNW-SSE were identified. The measured fractures vary from cemented (59%), partially filled (38%) to open-mode (3%). The cement in fractures is either gypsum or calcite. Applying the topology method analysis, the total number of nodes is 811, where the isolated nodes (I-type) account for 522, the termination nodes (Y-type) accounts for 222, and the cross-cutting nodes (X-type) are only 83. Microfractures are sharp with high-angle, closely spaced, open-mode fractures with lithology-induced terminations. The small vertical to sub-vertical fracture traces are terminated against the more resistant silty laminae. Pyrite shows positive correlation with the linear fracture density. The high amount of pyrite in association with high quartz and subordinate feldspars contents in the studied interval might have enhanced the brittleness of the lithologies and facilitated fracture propagation. Tectonically, two main fracture types exist in the studied section; shear and extensional fractures. The strike of the shear fractures in the study area is NE-SW and NW-SE directions. The open-mode, vertical long fractures cutting through the entire outcrop indicate an extension stress regime, which has already shaped the Tabuk Basin with multiple NW-SE rift structures.|| Baseline assessment of fish communities and selected environmental variables (salinity, water temperature, water transparency, current speed, total suspended solid, chlorophyll a) was conducted in Pampanga estuary (Philippines) during a specific dry season (April 2010). The aims were: (a) to examine the variations of fish diversity and community structure, in relation to neap and spring tides and estuary zones and; (b) to examine the influence of environmental variables on fish communities. Reconnaissance showed that salinity was measurable at 6.8 kilometers from the rivermouth, for the surface and mid-water layers, and at 15.9 kilometers for the bottom layers, indicating the occurrence of a salt wedge. Bottom salinity was used to establish the sampling stations, grouped into 3 zones (lower 1-3, middle 4-6, upper 7-9). Sampling of fish, using otter trawl, and measurement of environmental variables were done under four tidal conditions at each station (neap low and high tide; spring low and high tide). Neap tide showed low and homogenous horizontal salinity, higher temperature, slower current speed, high TSS and chlorophyll a, whereas, spring tide showed higher salinity, horizontal saline stratification, lower temperature, faster current speed, low TSS and chlorophyll a. A total of 330 fish were captured from 32 trawl samples, encompassing 20 families and 27 species. Number of species generally did not vary between neap (20) and spring tide (18), but showed a decreasing pattern from lower to the upper estuary. Only 36% of total species were shared between neap and spring tides. Fish abundance was significantly affected by neap and spring tide, and zonation, whereas fish biomass was solely affected by zonation. Arius manillensis was the most typifying species, suggesting high probability of encounter. Chlorophyll a, TSS, salinity and current speed have a significant influence on the variations of abundance, biomass and frequency of occurrence of particular fish species. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

A Cr(VI) stock solution was complexed with 1,5-diphenylcarbazide (DPC) reagent to form a metal ligand reaction, followed by UV-Vis spectrophotometric analysis at 540 nm. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and decanoic acids were also used for the microextraction of chromium speciation. Cr(III) was oxidized to Cr(VI) by using H2SO4 for the determination of total chromium. The Cr(III) concentration was calculated by subtracting the Cr(VI) concentration from total chromium. The parameters for sample volume, H2SO4 concentration, DPC concentration, and ultrasonic bath time were optimized at 20 mL, 0.002 mol L-1, 1.25x10(-4) mol L-1, and 4 min, respectively. The interference effects of the matrix components were also examined. The limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), enhancement factor, and the relative standard deviation were found at 0.79 mu g L-1, 2.64 mu g L-1, 50 and 2.40 %, respectively. The accuracy of the method was verified by analyzing two certified reference materials (TMDA-64.2 Fortified Lake Water and TMDA-53.3 Fortified Environmental Water). The proposed method was successfully used to the analysis of real environmental waters.|| nan|| The Qusaiba Shale Formation of the Qalibah Group is the most prolific source rock for the Paleozoic petroleum system in Saudi Arabia and is recently considered as a potential unconventional shale gas reservoir. Detailed sedimentological, petrographical, and geochemical analyses were undertaken on an similar to 31 m thick outcrop of this organic-rich shale exposed in the northwest of Tayma City, NW of Saudi Arabia to provide a better understanding of the vertical and lateral lithofacies variations and the effects of such variations on reservoir properties. X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that clay minerals (average: 50%) and quartz (average: 28%) dominate the bulk mineralogical composition while K-feldspar, plagioclase, and pyrite occur as common to minor components in the analyzed samples. An integration of the sedimentological description, petrography and mineralogical composition allows the subdivision of the investigated outcrop section into six lithofacies. These are: Laminated organic-rich shale, Graptolitic concretion, Massive organic-rich shale, Organic-lean shale, Siltstone-shale interbedded, and Cross-stratified siltstone/sandstone lithofacies. TOC content in the laminated and massive organic-rich shale lithofacies ranges between 0.5 and 6.1 wt% (average 2.52 wt%) then it decreases upward (0.04-0.35 wt%, average 0.18 wt%) in the overlying organic-lean shale and siltstone lithofacies. Trace elements (Cu, Mo, As, Ni, Co, U and V) show positive excursions in the lowermost 20 m of the organic-rich, dark-grey shale interval and display abrupt depletions at the contact with overlying organic-lean shale. The enrichment factors of these trace elements are characterized by similar distribution patterns as their measured concentrations. Like the elements, these factors also exhibit a significant depletion at the contact between the organic-rich shale and the overlying organic-lean shale. Out of all the redox indices, V/(V + Cr), V/(V + Ni), Th/U and [Mo] s /TOC were found to best distinguish between the organic-rich and the overlying organic-lean intervals. The laminated organic-rich shale lithofacies indicate deposition of hemipelagic sediments by a relatively low energy quiet anoxic bottom water, most likely in a sulfidic conditions that were associated with a strongly restricted bottom water mass circulation at the time of its deposition. This restricted hydrographic condition was likely enhanced in the study area due to the paleotopography that was created by the deglaciation of the Early Silurian time. The TOC richness, common occurrence of pyrite and high enrichment of redox elements Mo, U and V in the organic-rich shale intervals support the existence of anoxic bottom water at the time of deposition. The abrupt decrease of the TOC and the redox sensitive elements and their associated indices from the underlying organic-rich lithofacies to the overlying organic-lean shale lithofacies is likely due to a gradual increase in oxygen level. This improved bottom water oxygenation condition might have led to a reduction in organic productivity and limited organic matter preservation in the organic-lean shale lithofacies. The graptolitic concretion lithofacies found in the sequence, refers to an in-situ, syngenetic to early diagenetic origin formed close to the sediment-water layer when there was little or no deposition or at periods characterized by low sedimentation rates. The siltstone - fine sandstone lithofacies in the topmost part of the studied section, is interpreted to indicate the dominance of high energy and highly oxygenated shallow bottom water conditions during deposition, probably in a middle to inner shelf depositional settings. The kerogen in QS is a mixture of type III (gas prone) and type IV (inert kerogen), T-max values with an average of 430 degrees C, and VRo values (average 0.58) calculated from the T-max assigned the studied section as immature. Qualitative evaluation of porosity allows the identification of three different types of porosity including inorganic porosity, organic porosity and natural fracture porosity. Although the ductile clay minerals are the most abundant minerals in the lower part of the studied QS (average 56%), the brittle minerals (Quartz, Feldspar, and Pyrite) form an average of 42% and exhibit a uniform distribution of brittleness in the organic-rich interval.|| Ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) materials are receiving great attention in recent years and search for new ultrathin materials is continued after the isolation of the graphene. The 2D materials have displayed a wide range of different extraordinary properties that considered groundbreaking for various fields. Borophene is another magical 2D material addition to the family of ultrathin materials. Theoretically explained borophene has come into realism after the successful synthesis of 2D triangular structure on the Ag substrates in 2015. Unlike boron, the borophene has displayed a high metallic character. Borophene is a great conductor of heat and electricity. Borophene has exhibited high anisotropy and great flexibility. Most of the work on borophene is still theoretical and very little experimental work is observed. This review provided the current status of borophene, synthesis, and applications. Borophene is extensively being explored in the field of gas storage, batteries, catalysis, and sensors. It can help to achieve powerful high-performance batteries by serving as an electrode material and it has an excellent capacity to sense various toxic gases. It is predicted that borophene has a powerful capacity to store hydrogen fuel and act as a catalyst. In the coming years, the rapid surge in the borophene research to experimentally utilize its catalytic, electronic, and mechanical features is anticipated.|| This paper reports a deep-water coral framework (a single colonial bush or a larger bioconstruction of coral covering the sea bottom), formed entirely by the scleractinian coral Eguchipsammia fistula (Alcock, 1902) (Dendrophylliidae), in the northern Red Sea waters of Saudi Arabia at a depth of about 640 m. The framework consists of mostly live corals with a total area of about 10 m(2) and the length of the individual coral branches range from 12 to 30 cm. Although E. fistula is ubiquitous, this discovery is the second record of a framework formed by this species and the first discovery of a large living reef in the Red Sea. The results of the genetic study indicate the potential existence of a genetic variation of E. fistula in the Red Sea. This discovery implies that the Red Sea has favorable habitats for framework-forming DWC species and highlights the need for conducting more systematic surveys for understanding their distribution, abundance, and ecology.|| The development of new materials has significantly impacted the area of analytical sample preparation. In the last few years, a variety of new materials such as ionic liquids, carbon-based materials, metal and carbon-organic frameworks, and magnetic materials, have been utilized in the separation of analytes from different matrices. Among these, magnetic materials have attracted considerable attention because of their unique magnetic character that facilitates their easy retrieval during the extraction process. Besides, magnetic materials can be functionalized/modified with a variety of other materials to have desired functional moieties for selective extractions and to magnetize other materials for their easy separation. In this review, the existing and emerging magnetic extraction media have been classified based on the functional moieties that play a substantial role in the extraction of metals. This review also offers a critical discussion of the modern trends which are being practiced in magnetic analytical extractions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Using three data methods (examination of fishermen log-books, questionnaire survey and observer monitoring), the bycatch and discards associated with shrimp trawl fishery were studied, for two consecutive seasons (2013-2014 and 2014-2015), in the main shrimp fishing ground off Safaniya, along the Saudi coast in the Arabian Gulf. Safaniya fishing ground, with 37 large shrimp trawlers, was found to contribute a total shrimp catch of 500 to 755 t (up to 11% of the total national shrimp landings). Total bycatch (281-563 t) and discard (114-339 t) were substantial. A total of 104 fish and shellfish species were recorded in the bycatch, including 93 Osteichtyes, 3 Chondrichthyes, 6 Crustaceans and 3 Molluscs. The blue swimming crab, Portunus segnis, prevailed the bycatch (145-160 t), followed by the pharaoh cuttlefish Sepia pharaonis (2-16 t). Safaniya shrimp fishery was found to have high impacts on the shrimp (Penaeus semisulcatus; target species) juveniles and other commercial species. Estimations of total number of turtles captured in the catch ranged between 1492 and 2018, indicating a serious threat of shrimp fishery on local turtle populations. The results of this study emphasize the urgent need to adopt appropriate bycatch reduction devices in shrimp fishery, in addition to enforcement of fisheries management regulations in order to protect the non-target resources and ensure a sustainable shrimp production in the Arabian Gulf.|| Many industries produce 2,4-dimethylphenol (DMP) compound in the wastewater which is persistent, toxic, and carcinogenic. Therefore, an adsorbent was prepared by carbonizing a driedSargassum boveanummacroalgae. The prepared biosorbent was investigated for adsorptive removal of DMP from aqueous solution. After carbonization, the biochar derived fromS. boveanummacroalgae (BCM) removed almost 100% of DMP adsorbate. Effects of contact time, solution pH, adsorbate concentration, adsorbent mass, and temperature have been studied. It has been found that, within the experimental conditions, the maximum adsorption capacity is 17 mg/g, rate of adsorption follows pseudo-second order kinetics and the adsorption isotherm experimental data fit the Freundlich model. The thermodynamic parameters were calculated and it has been found that the adsorption of DMP on BCM is endothermic and thermodynamically favorable, and in addition the surface of BCM adsorbent shows affinity to the DMP molecules. The BCM adsorbent has the capability to remove around 65% of DMP from high saline seawater contaminated with DMP. Moreover, the prepared BCM adsorbent was reusable for at least four times in seawater for removal of DMP contaminant.|| In this work, we developed an extraction technique that can handle simple as well as complex matrixed liquid (aqueous) samples. In the standard liquid-liquid extraction, it is quite challenging to deal with complex liquid samples as they may complicate the process of phase separation and may lead to the formation of multiple layers. To resolve this issue, we have proposed a simple but unique idea that suggests the packing of the liquid samples inside a porous membrane bag. The edges of the membrane bag can be sealed using an electrical heat-sealer. The porous membrane bag filled with the liquid sample was immersed in an extraction solvent, and the extraction process was assisted by mechanical shaking. In order to demonstrate the proof of concept, a method was developed for the extraction of metals from seawater samples. The pH-adjusted sample, along with the complexing reagent, was packed inside the porous membrane bag, and the chelated complex was then extracted by immersing and shaking the bag inside the organic solvent. The solvent was then evaporated, and the chelated complex was dissolved/digested in acid with the aid of the heat. The final extract was subjected to Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analysis. The proposed method was used for extraction of eight metals (Cd, Co, Cu, Mo, Ni, Pb, V and Zn) from seawater samples and good extraction recoveries (75-94%) were obtained.|| Recruitment is one of the driving forces determining the population dynamics of a stock, and knowledge about recruitment is crucial in providing reliable results in modern stock assessment. The population of the American EelAnguilla rostrais at risk, and the fisheries on the elvers are one threat for its persistence. We applied a generalized depletion model on the catch and effort data of the elver fishery of the East River, Chester, Nova Scotia, from 1996 to 2018. The elver fishery of the East River did not have high exploitation pressure on the elver waves passing through. The natural mortality rate varied substantially among years, with a mean generally in agreement with other studies. The estimates of the model parameters did not exhibit significant temporal trends. Moreover, the estimate of annual elver abundance matched well with the fishery-independent abundance index, providing the first empirical support of the generalized depletion model. The generalized depletion model is an effective method to assess the exploitation status of elver fisheries, as well as providing an estimate of recruitment strength and natural mortality that can be used for stock assessment on the adult stocks when only fisheries-dependent catch and effort data are available.|| We used the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (coI) gene DNA to barcode 117 endemic Gulf and cosmopolitan Indo-West Pacific fish species belonging to 54 families and 13 orders. Novel DNA barcodes were provided for 18 fish species (Trachinocephalus sp., Nematalosa sp., Herklotsichthys lossei, Upeneus doriae, Trachurus indicus, Apogonichthyoides taeniatus, Verulux cypselurus, Favonigobius sp., Suezichthus gracilis, Sillago sp., Brachirus orientalis, Pegusa sp., Lepidotrigla bispinosa, Lepidotrigla sp., Grammoplites suppositus, Hippichthys sp., Paramonacanthus sp. and Triacanthus sp.). The species delimitation analysis, conducted with Poisson tree processes- Bayesian PTP (PTP-bPTP) and nucleotide-divergence-threshold (NDT) models), found 137 and 119 entities respectively. Overall, NDT method, neighbour-joining species tree and the prior taxonomic assessment provided similar results. Among the 54 families considered, only 10 (Ariommatidae, Ephippidae, Leiognathidae, Nemipteridae, Plotosidae, Pomacanthidae, Pomacentridae, Priacanthidae and Rachycentridae) showed the occurrence of molecular diagnostic pure characters. The DNA barcoding database developed during this study will help ichthyologists to identify and resolve the taxonomic ambiguities they may encounter with the fishes occurring in The Gulf and throughout the region.|| In this study we lay the groundwork for sustainability-oriented fisheries management, by estimating parameters the life history of orange-spotted trevally Carangoides bajad as well as trends of abundance in coral-reef habitats. We observed a new record of maximum size of 720 mm fork length. Carangoides bajad is a moderately long-lived (14 years) and slow-growing (K = 0.085 year(-1)) carangid species, closer to a K-selection species, with higher vulnerability to fishing and lower rates of recovery when the population level is low. Growth and biological composition in terms of length and age categories do not differ between the sexes, but females become mature faster. Reproductively active months (May-August) overlapped with those from Emirati waters further south. The abundance index showed a pronounced drop during 1990-1993, possibly in connection with habitat deterioration during the Gulf War (1990-1991) oil spill.

15,Information & Computer Science Department,Computer Science & Engineering,50,56,2,19,19,5,47.5,47.5,82,6,12,41,3,6,"|| Requirements Change Management (RCM) is one of the challenges faced by Global Software Development (GSD) organisations as requirements evolution is inevitable due to dynamic business and operating environments. GSD organisations face issues when dealing with RCM because many organisations embark on GSD without understanding their readiness to undertake such an initiative. Currently, there is no readiness model to assess the RCM process in the context of GSD. The objective of this study is to develop a requirements change management readiness model (RCMRM) for GSD organisations. A Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) was conducted to identify the primary studies related to RCM in the GSD projects. By using SMS, 109 primary studies were selected and 73 RCM practices were identified which were used to design the readiness levels of the proposed RCMRM. To validate the RCMRM, initially, two case studies were conducted in two GSD organisations. Based on the suggestions and recommendations of the case study participants,the RCMRM was further modified. The updated version of RCMRM was further validated by two different GSD organisations. The results of the second case study indicate that RCMRM is effective in assessing the readiness of the RCM process in the context of GSD.|| Software systems are often developed in such a way that good practices in the object-oriented paradigm are not met, causing the occurrence of specific disharmonies which are sometimes called code smells. Design patterns catalogue best practices for developing object-oriented software systems. Although code smells and design patterns are widely divergent, there might be a co-occurrence relation between them. The objective of this paper is to empirically evaluate if the presence of design patterns is related to the presence of code smells at different granularity levels. We performed an empirical study using 20 design patterns and 13 code smells in ten small-size to medium-size, open source Java-based systems. We applied statistical analysis and association rules. Results confirm that classes participating in design patterns have less smell-proneness and smell frequency than classes not participating in design patterns. We also noticed that every design pattern category act in the same way in terms of smell-proneness in the subject systems. However, we observed, based on the association rules learning and the proposed validation technique, that some patterns may be associated with certain smells in some cases. For instance, Command patterns can co-occur with God Class, Blob and External Duplication smell.|| Code smells are indicators of potential problems in software. They tend to have a negative impact on software quality. Several studies use machine learning techniques to detect bad smells. The objective of this study is to systematically review and analyze machine learning techniques used to detect code smells to provide interested research community with knowledge about the adopted techniques and practices for code smells detection. We use a systematic literature review approach to review studies that use machine learning techniques to detect code smells. Seventeen primary studies were identified. We found that 27 code smells were used in the identified studies; God Class and Long Method, Feature Envy, and Data Class are the most frequently detected code smells. In addition, we found that 16 machine learning algorithms were employed to detect code smells with acceptable prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we the results also indicate that support vector machine techniques were investigated the most. Moreover, we observed that J48 and Random Forest algorithms outperform the other algorithms. We also noticed that, in some cases, the use of boosting techniques on the models does not always enhance their performance. More studies are needed to consider the use of ensemble learning techniques, multiclassification, and feature selection technique for code smells detection. Thus, the application of machine learning algorithms to detect code smells in systems is still in its infancy and needs more research to facilitate the employment of machine learning algorithms in detecting code smells.|| Use case modelling is an industrial de-facto standard technique to express functional requirements. Security bad smells are design flaws that can potentially degrade the quality of software by affecting a system's ability to prevent malicious activities. The presence of security bad smells in a use case model is likely to propagate security vulnerabilities to other software artefacts. Therefore, the detection and refactoring of security bad smells in use case models is important for ensuring the overall quality of software systems. In this paper, we propose a genetic algorithm-based detection approach to detect security bad smells. A refactoring process is then applied to correct the security bad smells. Finally, the improvement to security is assessed through the statistical analysis of quality metrics. The practicality of the approach is demonstrated by applying it to a set of use case models. The results show that the proposed security bad smell detection and correction technique can significantly improve the quality of use case models.|| Human face is one of the most important biometrics as it contains information such as gender, race, and age. Identifying the gender based on human face images is a challenging problem that has been extensively studied due to its various relevant applications. Several approaches were used to address this problem by specifying suitable features. In this study, we present an extension of feature extraction technique based on statistical aggregation and Gabor filters. We extract statistical features from the image of a face after applying Gabor filters; subsequently, we use seven classifiers to investigate the performance of the selected features. Experiments show that the accuracy achieved using the proposed features is comparable to accuracies reported in recent studies. We used seven classifiers to investigate the performance of our proposed features. Experiments reveal that k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (k-NN), K-Star classifier (K*), and Rotation Forest offer the best accuracies.|| High availability (HA) is becoming an increasingly important requirement in a growing number of domains. It is even mandatory for critical systems, such as networking and communications, that cannot afford downtime. Such systems often monitor the state of crucial services and produce huge amounts of execution trace data, where functional and non-functional log entries are intertwined; hence they are hard to dissociate and analyze. Dynamic analysis aims at capturing and analyzing run-time behavior of a system based on its execution traces. In this paper, we apply dynamic analysis to retrieve and analyze HA scenarios from system execution traces. Our proposed approach aims to help analysts understand and report on how a highly available system detects and recovers from failures. As a proof of concept, we have selected the Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) in order to demonstrate the applicability of our approach. We have evaluated empirically the effectiveness of our technique using four real-world case studies of IP networks running HSRP. Results have shown that high availability scenarios were successfully retrieved and analyzed. Moreover, results have shown that our prototype tool HAAnalyzer was able to effectively unveil high availability behavioral and temporal errors, that were seeded in the execution traces.

Around 85% of the new cases occurred in less-developed countries. In these countries, the high fatality rate is mainly attributed to the lack of skilled medical staff and appropriate medical prescreening procedures. Images capturing the cervical region, known as cervigrams, are the gold-standard for the basic evaluation of cervical cancer presence. Cervigrams have high inter-rater variability especially among less skilled medical specialists. In this paper, we develop a fully-automated pipeline for cervix detection and cervical cancer classification from cervigram images. The proposed pipeline consists of two pre-trained deep learning models for the automatic cervix detection and cervical tumor classification. The first model detects the cervix region 1000 times faster than state-of-the-art data-driven models while achieving a detection accuracy of 0.68 in terms of intersection of union (IoU) measure. Self-extracted features are used by the second model to classify the cervix tumors. These features are learned using two lightweight models based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). The proposed deep learning classifier outperforms existing models in terms of classification accuracy and speed. Our classifier is characterized by an area under the curve (AUC) score of 0.82 while classifying each cervix region 20 times faster. Finally, the pipeline accuracy, speed and lightweight architecture make it very appropriate for mobile phone deployment. Such deployment is expected to drastically enhance the early detection of cervical cancer in less-developed countries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To gain insights on the current research trends on machine learning for big data analytics, this study follows a bibliometric analysis methodology of citation data to review and quantitatively assess the explosion and impact of literature and research performance in this vibrant research area, which has witnessed rapid changes and rising interest in business, industry and academia. Using a variety of bibliometric measures and visualisation techniques, the paper examines and identifies several related issues including research productivity and directions, major contributors, publication trends and growth rates, citation and collaboration analysis, and others. The relevant bibliographic units for the study were collected from the Core Collection of the Web of Science bibliographic database. Nearly all the relevant publications prior to February 2018 were included in the analysis. The overwhelming productivity and wide-spread applications in several multidisciplinary domains have been revealed, with one-to-two ratio of journal to conference publications. Three countries (USA, China, India) are dominating the research output with more than two-thirds of the total productivity.|| With the widespread of online videos and digital transformation, video informatics and analytics have recently gained substantially increasing importance with an impressive success in a variety of tasks such as digital marketing, video surveillance and security systems, healthcare systems, talk show analysis, analysis of influencing groups in social media, and target tracking. This paper evaluates the potential contribution of various video modalities and how they are correlated to video analytics for sentiment analysis in the morphologically-rich Arabic language. Moreover, an enhanced approach is presented for video analytics to predict the speaker's sentiment of multi-dialect Arabic through the integration of textual, auditory and visual modalities. Different features are extracted to represent each modality including prosodic and spectral acoustic features to represent audio, neural word embedding to represent audio text transcript, and dense optical-flow descriptors to represent visual modality. The extracted features are used individually to train two machine learning classifiers to provide a baseline. Then, the effectiveness of various combinations of modalities is verified using multi-level fusion (feature, score and decision). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach of combining different modalities can lead to more accurate prediction of speaker's sentiment with above 94% accuracy.|| With the proliferation of social media and mobile technology, huge amount of unstructured data is posted daily online. Consequently, sentiment analysis has gained increasing importance as a tool to understand the opinions of certain groups of people on contemporary political, cultural, social or commercial issues. Unlike western languages, the research on sentiment analysis for dialectical Arabic language is still in its early stages with several challenges to be addressed. The main goal of this study is twofold. First, it compares the performance of core machine learning algorithms for detecting the polarity in imbalanced Arabic tweet datasets using neural word embedding as a feature extractor rather than hand-crafted or traditional features. Second, it examines the impact of using various oversampling techniques to handle the highly-imbalanced nature of the sentiment data. Intensive empirical analysis of nine machine learning methods and six oversampling methods has been conducted and the results have been discussed in terms of a wide range of performance measures.|| Document layout analysis (DLA) is a preprocessing step of document understanding systems. It is responsible for detecting and annotating the physical structure of documents. DLA has several important applications such as document retrieval, content categorization, text recognition, and the like. The objective of DLA is to ease the subsequent analysis/recognition phases by identifying the document-homogeneous blocks and by determining their relationships. The DLA pipeline consists of several phases that could vary among DLA methods, depending on the documents' layouts and final analysis objectives. In this regard, a universal DLA algorithm that fits all types of document-layouts or that satisfies all analysis objectives has not been developed, yet. In this survey paper, we present a critical study of different document layout analysis techniques. The study highlights the motivational reasons for pursuing DLA and discusses comprehensively the different phases of the DLA algorithms based on a general framework that is formed as an outcome of reviewing the research in the field. The DLA framework consists of preprocessing, layout analysis strategies, post-processing, and performance evaluation phases. Overall, the article delivers an essential baseline for pursuing further research in document layout analysis.|| A sequence diagram is a modeling approach for visualizing the behavioral execution of a system. The objective of this research is to investigate the problem of security in a behavioral model (sequence diagram) through the application of model refactoring. We propose detection and correction techniques, empirical evaluation of the proposed techniques and assessment of security improvement in sequence diagrams. The detection of security bad smells is achieved through the adaptation of a genetic algorithm, while correction is accomplished by the model transformation approach. The results show significant detection recall and correction efficacy of the proposed detection and correction approaches, respectively. Our results show that the proposed approach is effective in detecting and correcting bad smells and can improve the security of UML Sequence Diagram.|| With the advent of IoT, storing, indexing and querying XML data efficiently is critical. To minimize the cost of querying XML data, researchers have proposed many indexing techniques. Nearly all the techniques, partition the XML data into a number of data-streams. To evaluate a query, existing twig pattern matching algorithms process a subset of the data-streams simultaneously. Processing many data-streams simultaneously results in some or all of the following four problems, namely, the accessing of many data nodes which don't appear in the final solution of a given query, the generation of duplicate results, the generation of huge number of intermediate results, and the cost of merging the generated intermediate results. To the best of our knowledge, all the existing twig pattern matching algorithms suffer from some or all of the above mentioned problems. This paper proposes a new twig pattern matching algorithm called MatchQTP which processes one data-stream at a time and avoids all the above mentioned four problems. It also proposes a new indexing technique called RLP-Index and a new XML node labeling scheme called RLP-Scheme, both of which are used by MatchQTP. Unlike the existing indexing techniques, RLP-Index stores a subset of the data nodes. The rest of the data nodes can be generated efficiently. This minimizes storage space utilization and query processing time and makes RLP-Index the first of its kind. Many experiments were conducted to study the performance of MatchQTP. The results show that MatchQTP is very efficient and highly scalable. It was also compared with four algorithms, three of which are used frequently in the literature to compare the performance of new algorithms and the fourth algorithm is the state-of-the-art algorithm. MatchQTP significantly and consistently outperformed all of them|| Unlike sub-metering, which requires individual appliances to be equipped with their own meters, non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) use algorithms to discover appliance individual consumption from the aggregated overall energy reading. Approaches that uses low frequency sampled data are more applicable in a real world smart meters that has typical sampling capability of <= 1Hz. In this paper, a systematic literature review on deep-learning-based approaches for NILM problem is conducted, aiming to analyse the four key aspects pertaining to deep learning adoption. This includes deep learning model adoption, features selection that are used to train the model, used data set and model accuracy. In our study, analyses the performance of four different deep learning approaches, namely, denoising autoencoder (DAE), recurrent long short-term memory (LSTM), Recurrent gate recurrent unit (GRU), and sequence to point. Our experiments will be conducted using the two data sets, namely, REDD and UK-DALE. According to our analysis, the sequence to point model has achieved the best results with an average mean absolute error (MAE) of 14:98 watt when compared to other counterpart algorithms.|| Refactoring a software artifact is an embedded task in the maintenance phase of the software life cycle. To reduce the time and effort required for this task, researchers proposed methods to automate the software refactoring process at the design and code levels. In this paper, we conducted a systematic literature review of papers that suggest, propose, or implement an automated refactoring process. Using different phases, setting several quality measures, and snowballing, only 41 papers passed to the last stage to be analyzed and reviewed. We observe an increase in the number of papers that propose automatic refactoring. The results show that while most of the papers discuss code refactoring, only a few recent papers are focused on model refactoring. Search-based refactoring is gaining more popularity, and several researchers have used it to perform refactoring in a quick and efficient manner.|| There are several digital libraries worldwide which maintain valuable historical manuscripts. Usually, digital copies of these manuscripts are offered to researchers and readers in raster-image format. These images carry several document degradations that may hinder automatic information retrieval solutions such as manuscript indexing, categorization, retrieval by content, etc. In this paper, we propose a learning-free and hybrid document layout analysis for handwritten historical manuscripts. It has two main phases: page characterization and segmentation. First, the proposed method locates main-content initially using top-down whitespace analysis. It employs anisotropic diffusion filtering to find whitespaces. Then, it extracts template features representing manuscripts' authors writing behavior. After that, moving windows are used to scan the manuscript page and define main-content boundaries more precisely. We evaluated the proposed method on two datasets: One set is publicly available with 38 historical manuscript pages, and the other set of 51 historical manuscript pages that are collected from the online Harvard Library. Experiments on both datasets show promising results in terms of segmentation quality of main-content that reaches up to 98.5% success rate.|| Security is considered to be a critical software quality attribute. Tackling security at the requirements phase helps to avoid the need to rework secure software development issues. The aim of this paper is to develop a Requirements Engineering (RE) Security Maturity Model (RESMM) to assist software development organizations to better specify the requirements for secure software development. To achieve this objective, first, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify the requirement practices for secure software development. Then we modified Sommerville's requirements engineering practices. We also conducted a questionnaire survey based on the identified security requirements practices. Next, the RESMM was built based on the results of the SLR, the modified Sommerville practices and feedback from the security practitioners. Finally, two case studies were conducted to assess RESMM. RESMM has 79 practices classified into 7 RE categories. The case study results show that RESMM has a clear structure and is easy to comprehend and use. In addition, the case study participants recommended that software organizations adopt RESMM. RESMM has the ability to identify the RE security maturity levels in software organizations. RESMM can also help software development organizations deliver secure software. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Software stability quantifies a given systems sensitivity to change between different versions. Stable software tends to reduce the maintenance effort. Assessing software stability during the object-oriented design phase is one of the measures to obtain maintainable software. To determine software stability, there are several metrics at the architecture, system and class levels, but few studies have investigated stability at the package level. Objective: In this paper, we propose a new package stability metrics (PSM) based on the notion of change between package contents, intra-package connections and inter-package connections. Method: We validate the PSM theoretically and empirically. The theoretical validation is based on a study of the mathematical properties of the metrics. The empirical validation is carried out using five open source software programs and we also present a comparison with comparable existing stability metrics packages. For the empirical validation, we perform correlation analysis, principal component analysis and prediction analysis. Results: Correlation analysis shows that our proposed metrics provides a better indication of package stability than the existing stability metrics and they are negatively correlated with the maintenance effort. Principal component analysis shows that the proposed metrics captures new dimensions of package stability and helps to increase the maintenance prediction accuracy. Conclusion: We found there was a negative correlation between our metric and maintenance effort. We also found a positive correlation between the existing package stability metrics which are based on changes in lines of code and class names.|| Nowadays, many applications use biometric systems as a security purpose. These systems use fingerprints, iris, retina, hand geometry, etc. that have unique patterns from person to another. The human face is one of the most important organs that has many physiological characteristics such as the subject gender, race, age, and mood. Determining the gender of the face can reduce the processing time of large-scale face-based systems and may improve the performance. Many studies were proposed for gender recognition, but several were evaluated using the accuracy as a performance metric which is improper for unbalanced data. Further, they used a grayscale color; and extracted features either from the whole image or equally divided blocks, as a grid. In this paper, novel methods are proposed based on statistical features that have the ability to represent the face landmarks. These features are GIST, pyramid histogram of oriented gradients, GIST based on discrete cosine transform and principal component analysis that are extracted using face local regions. The performances are evaluated using area-under-the-curve that is computed from the receiver operating characteristic or ROC curve. At the end, the acquired performance has been compared by two state-of-the-art techniques that shows that the proposed approaches enhance the performance between 1 and 3%, but the number of features is increased.|| Traffic classification in computer networks has very significant roles in network operation, management, and security. Examples include controlling the flow of information, allocating resources effectively, provisioning quality of service, detecting intrusions, and blocking malicious and unauthorized access. This problem has attracted a growing attention over years and a number of techniques have been proposed ranging from traditional port-based and payload inspection of TCP/IP packets to supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised machine learning paradigms. With the increasing complexity of network environments and support for emerging mobility services and applications, more robust and accurate techniques need to be investigated. In this paper, we propose a new supervised hybrid machine-learning approach for ubiquitous traffic classification based on multicriteria fuzzy decision trees with attribute selection. Moreover, our approach can handle well the imbalanced datasets and zero-day applications (i.e., those without previously known traffic patterns). Evaluating the proposed methodology on several benchmark real-world traffic datasets of different nature demonstrated its capability to effectively discriminate a variety of traffic patterns, anomalies, and protocols for unencrypted and encrypted traffic flows. Comparing with other methods, the performance of the proposed methodology showed remarkably better classification accuracy.|| Requirements and their models often evolve to reflect changing needs, technologies, and regulations. The decision to implement proposed changes to requirements models relies on means to capture and analyze the potential impact of such changes. The User Requirements Notation (URN) is a standardized requirements modeling language that incorporates two complementary views based on Use Case Maps (UCM), for expressing scenarios and processes bound to architectural components, and on the Goal-oriented Requirement Language (GRL), for capturing the goals of actors and their relationships. This paper presents a new Change Impact Analysis (CIA) approach for URN models. Following a proposed change, this approach helps identify potentially impacted URN constructs within the selected GRL/UCM view, as well as throughout other view elements connected with URN links. This URN-oriented CIA approach is implemented as an extension of the jUCMNav modeling environment, and its applicability is demonstrated using an illustrative URN specification and three real and publicly available specifications. Furthermore, an empirical study involving 10 participants is used to assess the accuracy of this approach in identifying impacted URN elements upon specification changes. Results indicate excellent accuracy and a significant reduction in user-perceived difficulty when estimating the impact of changes in URN specifications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Code clones are segments of code that are very similar. Software stability tends to measure the unchanged code elements. The objective of this paper is to find whether stability metrics can be used as an indicator of code structural similarity. I perform an empirical study to find the relationship between code similarity and stability at the class level. I also conduct clustering to classify stability and similarity metrics into different related groups. Finally, I perform principal component analysis to determine which class stability metrics have the strongest relationship with class similarity. In addition, I built a prediction model to predict class similarity using class stability metrics. The results show that the four investigated stability metrics have a significant relationship with similarity; however, the class stability metric (CSM) has the strongest correlation with code similarity. The clustering results also reveal that classes with high stability tend to have high similarity. In addition, I found that the CSM and class instability metric (CII) can both reveal 74.023% of class similarity. I conclude that stability metrics can be used as a good indicator of class similarity.|| Universities and research institutes suffer from limitations on the current services provided by their traditional IT infrastructures to all their various end users. Also, overheads, which are caused by managing, upgrading and maintaining all the traditional IT components and services, are very high compared to virtual infrastructures. Utilizing cloud technology can help enhance the learning experience in higher education. Integrating VDI platforms and hyper- visors can build virtualizaion environments to provide VDs. Thus, when applying virtualization to an infrastructural environment, is it better for universities and research institutes to adopt and utilize a specific VDI platform along with its suitable hypervisor. This article proposes and evaluates such a vision to utilize cloud computing services in teaching and research.|| Enhancing educational and research environments in universities and research institutions is continually chal-lenging. Currently, educational organizations provide physical facilities to their staff and students. Such setups can be expensive, inflexible and difficult to maintain and suffer from the limitations on the services provided by their traditional information technology infrastructures to their various end users. Also, the overheads which are caused by managing, upgrading and maintaining all the traditional IT components and services are very high compared to virtualization environments. The aim is to utilize and to enhance one of the cloud computing technologies, Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), for supporting teaching and research activities within an educational organization. Cloud computing has redefined the view of computing resources as a framework where these resources are provisioned dynamically on demand. With cloud computing, these resources can be delivered to users across geographical and time boundaries. For example, virtualization stores the resulting virtualized desktop on a remote central server, instead of on the local storage of a remote client; thus, when users work from their remote desktop client, all of the programs, applications, processes, and data used are kept and run centrally. In this article, we explore VDI platforms and evaluate their suitability for universities and research institutes. We study the performance for these well-known VDI platforms, namely VMware Horizon and Citrix XenDesktop, using the Login VSI tool as software benchmarking. Performance evaluations are conducted using homogeneous architectural designs.|| Software metrics are used to measure different attributes of software. To practically measure software attributes using these metrics, metric thresholds are needed. Many researchers attempted to identify these thresholds based on personal experiences. However, the resulted experience-based thresholds cannot be generalized due to the variability in personal experiences and the subjectivity of opinions. The goal of this paper is to propose an automated clustering framework based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm where clusters are generated using a simplified 3-metric set (LOC, LCOM, and CBO).

The main purpose of this Review is to provide an overview of the utilization of H-NPs and M-NPs in various environmental remediation. Iron-based NPs are extensively explored to generate green energy from environmental friendly processes such as water splitting and CO2 conversion to hydrogen and low molecular weight hydrocarbons, respectively. The latter part of the Review provided a critical overview to use H-NPs and M-NPs for the detection and decontamination of inorganic and organic contaminants to counter the environmental pollution and toxicity challenge, which could ensure environmental sustainability and hygiene. Some of the future perspectives are comprehensively presented in the final portion of the script, optimiztically, and it is supported by some relevant literature surveys to predict the possible routes of H-NPs and M-NPs modifications that could enable researchers to use these NPs in more advanced environmental applications. The literature collection and discussion on the critical assessment of reserving the environmental sustainability challenges provided in this Review will be useful not only for experienced researchers but also for novices in the field.|| The swelling of shale formation upon exposure to water-based drilling fluids leads to several problems. Common shale (clay) inhibitors used in the industry have several shortcomings which adversely affect the drilling mud properties. This study involves the development, application, and mechanism of new quaternary ammonium gemini cationic surfactants as clay swelling inhibitors. These gemini surfactants are structurally similar but different in terms of the spacer lengths. The inhibition characteristics of gemini surfactants were evaluated using a linear swell tester, capillary suction timer, scanning electron microscope (SEM), rheology, filtration, wettability, and zeta potential analysis. It was observed that the new gemini cationic surfactants with various lengths of spacers reduced the clay swelling. The GS12 surfactant, containing flexible large spacer C12 proved to be a beneficial swelling inhibitor as compared to GS8 and GS10 due to increased hydrophobicity. It also showed acceptable performance compared to the common shale inhibitor used in the industry. SEM images revealed that water caused significant damage to clay structures showing irregular and sharp edges. However, the surfactant-treated clay showed a fine, dense, and smooth surface. An inhibition mechanism using synthesized surfactants was also proposed. Experimental tests showed the synthesized surfactants adsorb and intercalate between layers of clay through hydrogen bonding and attractive electrostatic forces. The orientation of lipophilic tails inhibits the water adsorption in the clay which results in reduced clay swelling. The synthesized surfactants reduced the clay swelling without affecting the other mud properties such as rheology, stability, and filtration properties. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

These surfactants possess similar hydrophobic tails, ethoxy units, and head groups, and the effect of the nature of the spacer on the IFT was exclusively studied. These surfactants were mainly classified into three different groups to examine the effect of spacer length, unsaturation, and aromaticity. The spacers of the first group of the surfactants were composed of different numbers of methylene units (4, 6, 8, 10, and 12). The second group consists of three surfactants where the spacers have saturation, unsaturation with a double bond, and unsaturation with a triple bond. The surfactants of the third group consist of four surfactants that have mono- and biphenyl rings in the spacer, in addition to different counterions. The experiments were performed at different surfactant concentrations and at different NaCI concentrations. The model oils used were n-decane and n-hexadecane. Increasing the spacer length from 4 to 10 reduced the IFT of the water/oil system irrespective of surfactant concentration, salinity, and oil type. A further increase in the spacer length from 10 to 12 increased the IFT. Moreover, both surfactants with a single bond and a double bond in their spacers did not have significant differences in IFT values. However, the surfactant with a triple bond spacer exhibited considerably lower IFT than the surfactant with a single or double bond spacer. The rigidity induced by the unsaturation of the spacer was the main reason for varying IFT values. Surfactants containing two phenyl rings in the spacer showed lower IFT compared to the surfactant-containing single phenyl rings. Moreover, chloride counterions on the phenyl rings accentuate the decrease in IFT when compared to bromide ions due to the ease of chloride ions associating with water molecules. This study showed that for a similar tail and head, spacer characteristics can have a substantial impact on the IFT. Moreover, it can help in understanding how to choose optimal spacers for IFT reduction.|| Hydration of shale formation by water-based drilling fluids leads to several problems, such as the collapse of boreholes, tight holes, and stuck pipe, which may impede further drilling and time loss in rectifying the problems, leading to heavy economic losses. This study reports the development of new gemini cationic surfactants as shale-swelling inhibitors. These gemini surfactants are structurally similar but differ in terms of the spacer group. Saturated butyl group (GS1) and unsaturated 2-butenyl (GS2) and 2-butynyl (GS3) were introduced as spacer groups of gemini surfactants. To assess the performance of new gemini cationic surfactants, two reliable clay sources were considered. The first clay is from an unconventional formation and the second clay is sodium bentonite. The inhibition characteristics of gemini surfactants were evaluated using dynamic swelling, hot rolling, rheology, and filtration experiments. Different formulations based on commercially available solutions for shale-swelling inhibitors were applied and compared with cationic shale inhibitors. It was observed that the new gemini cationic surfactants with different spacers (saturated and unsaturated) reduced the shale swelling by different percentages. The GS2 surfactant, containing an unsaturated double bond proved to be a good swelling inhibitor as compared to GS1 and GS3. It also showed acceptable performance compared with the common shale inhibitor (KCl) used in the industry. The addition of surfactant has less impact on the rheological properties as compared to KCl. The filtration properties of the base mud were unchanged when surfactants were used. However, the commercial inhibitor, KCl, significantly increased the filtration volume that is associated with the disintegration of the clay. In summary, unlike commercial inhibitors, the synthesized surfactants reduced the clay swelling without affecting the other properties of the drilling fluids.|| Compatible surfactant-polymer (SP) hybrid systems at high temperature are in great demand due to the necessity of chemical flooding in high-temperature oil reservoirs. The rheological properties of novel SP systems were studied. The SP system used in this study consists of a commercial polymer and four in-house synthesized polyoxyethylene cationic gemini surfactants with various spacers (mono phenyl and biphenyl ring) and different counterions (bromide and chloride). The impact of surfactant concentration, spacer nature, counterions, and temperature on the rheological features of SP solutions was examined using oscillation and shear measurements. The results were compared with a pure commercial polymer. All surfactants exhibited good thermal stability in seawater with no precipitation. Shear viscosity and storage modulus were measured as a function of shear rate and angular frequency, respectively. The experimental results revealed that the novel SP solution with a mono phenyl and chloride counterions produces a better performance in comparison with the SP solution, which contains mono phenyl and bromide counterions. Moreover, the effect is enhanced when the mono phenyl ring is replaced with a biphenyl ring. Shear viscosity and storage modulus decrease by increasing surfactant concentration at the same temperature, due to the charge screening effect. Storage modulus and complex viscosity reduce by increasing the temperature at a constant angular frequency of 10 rad/s. Among all studied SP systems, a surfactant containing a biphenyl ring in the spacer with chloride as a counterion has the least effect on the shear viscosity of the polymer. This study improves the understanding of tuning the surfactant composition in making SP solutions with better rheological properties.|| An efficient drilling fluid will form a filter cake that will minimize the drilling fluid invasion into any drilled formation. Drilling fluid must therefore be adequately evaluated in the laboratory prior to field trial. Filter cake properties such as thickness, porosity, permeability, and pore structure are frequently evaluated using several techniques such as CT scan, SEM, and XRF. However, each of these techniques can evaluate only one or two filter cake properties. This paper presents a simple but novel NMR technique to evaluate filter cake properties such as thickness, pore volume, porosity, and possibly permeability. Furthermore, the amount and particle size distribution of solids that invaded a given rock sample can be obtained using the same technique. The full procedure was tested and verified using four identical rock samples. Drilling fluid invasion and filter cake deposition experiments were conducted on each of the samples, using the same drilling fluid but four different concentrations of fluid loss additive. NMR T-2 relaxation measurements were taken at three different stages of each rock sample: before filter cake deposition; after fluid invasion and filter cake deposition; and after filter cake removal. A material balance analysis of the probability density function and cumulative distribution function of the measured T-2 profile at the different stages of each sample yielded multiple filtration loss properties of the filter cake. The results obtained showed high accuracy of the NMR versus the current techniques. Moreover, this current method evaluated the majority of the filter cake properties at the same time and in situ hence eliminated the need of using multi-procedures that disturb the sample state. Finally, the presented method can also be used to evaluate secondary damage associated with filter cake removal process.|| It is central to understand the underlying factors that affect the generation and stabilization of foam. Nevertheless, reports on how foam stability is impacted by surfactant concentration, electrolyte concentration, and electrolyte nature are ambiguous. This paper summarizes the foaming properties below and above the critical micelle concentration (CMC) at various electrolyte concentrations. The commonly used surfactant, alpha olefin sulfonate (AOS), was used along with NaCl in a range of concentrations. The foam height, foam volume stability, bubble count, and foam structure were studied to determine the foam behavior at given conditions. The optimum surfactant concentration for the formation of a stable micellar film was found to be just above the CMC value and the foam stability on the addition of salts is related to the surfactant concentration. There exists another critical concentration (not CMC) that is important to determine the impact of salts on the stability of the foam. The addition of NaCl does not have the same impact below and above this critical concentration. If the concentration of surfactant is below the critical concentration, addition of NaCl reduces the half-life and foam stability. However, at higher surfactant concentrations, the presence of NaCl improves the half-life and foam stability. This study clarifies the ambiguities that are present in the literature pertaining to the effect of salt on foam stability and foaming properties.|| Thermal stability, salt tolerance, and solubility in normal and high salinity brine are the major requirements for any surfactant designed for oilfield applications because the surfactant stays in a non-ambient environment inside the reservoir for a long period of time. Herein, a series of new gemini cationic surfactants (GSs) with varying spacer hydrophilicity were synthesized and elucidated using MALDI-ToF-MS, NMR (1H, 13C), as well as FTIR spectroscopy. GSs found to be soluble in normal as well as high salinity brine and aqueous stability tests revealed that GSs possess the ability to retain their structural integrity at high salinity and high temperature conditions because no suspension formation or precipitation was detected in the oven aged sample of GSs at 90 degrees C for 30 days. Thermal gravimetric analysis displayed a higher decomposition temperature than the real reservoir temperature and the GS with a secondary amine spacer exhibited high heat stability. The significant reduction in surface tension and critical micelle concentration was observed using 1 M NaCl solution in place of deionized water. The difference in surface tension and critical micelle concentration was insignificant when the 1 M NaCl solution was replaced with seawater. The synthesized surfactants can be utilized for oilfield applications in a challenging high temperature high salinity environment.|| More than half of the global oil reserves are in carbonate reservoirs. Carbonate rocks, however, in most cases tend to be mixed-wet or oil-wet. Wettability alteration of carbonate reservoir rock has been proven to increase oil recovery significantly. Several chemicals have shown their effect on wettability; however, selection of an appropriate wettability modifier should be made on the basis of the underlying mechanisms and their behavior at reservoir conditions. This review discusses techniques that can help in assessing wettability alteration or reflect on the underlying mechanism and describes several categories of wettability modifiers focusing on their structure-property relationship and factors affecting their performance at reservoir conditions. Surfactants, nanoparticles, salts, and alkalis are four major categories of wettability modifiers that are discussed in this review. Among surfactants, gemini surfactants have great potential and could be a major focus of future research in this area. Nanoparticles are relatively novel materials for wettability alteration with the capability to reduce contact angle significantly at low cost. This review also identifies the current and future challenges related to the performance of various wettability modifiers at high-temperature and high-salinity conditions.|| In this work, a new method to evaluate the reaction kinetics of different stimulation fluids with carbonate rocks was introduced. NMR diffusion measurements were used to determine the acid diffusion coefficient and the acid tortuous path inside carbonate rocks. Reaction kinetics can also be evaluated using rotating disk apparatus (RDA) in which a disc is rotated in the bulk fluid at different rotational speeds. RDA does not represent the actual, restricted acid diffusion that takes place in the porous media because only the surface of the rock is exposed to the reaction and the acid is not confined in the porous media. NMR diffusion measurements can accurately describe and determine the acid restricted diffusion in porous media. The diffusion coefficient of the acid is a crucial term in describing the reaction kinetics of acids with carbonate rocks. It is also used to predict the optimum injection rate required during the acidizing treatment and the soaking time for different fluids required to remove scales and deposits in the wellbore. The restricted diffusion was determined for different fluids such as GLDA chelating agent, HEDTA chelating agent, and EDTA chelating agent. Core flooding experiments for each fluid were conducted to determine the optimum injection rate. NMR restricted diffusion measurements then were conducted to determine the restricted diffusion and in turn to determine the optimum injection rate. The optimum injection rate estimated from the NMR was compared to that from the core flooding experiments. The results were a good match showing that NMR is a suitable, reliable, and robust method to evaluate reaction kinetics of different fluids with carbonate rocks.|| Sandstone acidizing treatments are conducted to remove the damage in the near-wellbore area and restore the well productivity. Clays and feldspars are abundant in sandstone formations and they have very large surface area compared to quartz and this will deplete the injected HF acid and prevent its deep penetration to remove the damage. There are several environmental and formation damage concerns with the existing retarders such as aluminum chloride, boric acid, and phosphonic acids. In this study, a newly synthesized cationic gemini surfactant was investigated as a new retarder during sandstone acidizing using HF/HCl mud acid system. The new surfactant adsorbed on clays and feldspars surfaces and prevent their reaction with the HF/HCl mud acid. This will allow for more reaction with silicate and the acid can penetrate deeper and remove the damage. Coreflooding experiments were conducted using 12-inch long Scioto sandstone cores with very high clay contents. This work also included a numerical modeling study of the mud acid reactive transport in sandstone. The calibrated model was then implemented to predict the new surfactant impacts on the mud acid penetration and permeability enhancement at field-scale. Numerical simulation was done on the core and field scales. Coreflooding experiments showed that, flushing the rock sample with a 0.5 wt% solution of the new surfactant before the acid treatment minimized the interactions between both HCl and HF with clays and feldspars. This was confirmed by the pressure drop profile during the treatment, ICP cation analysis, and HF concentration collected from the coreflooding effluent. The numerical study showed that the new surfactant could reduce the minerals' surface area exposed to the mud acid by five times. The field-scale simulations showed that the new system would result in an important increase in the acid penetration length and permeability improvement.|| Wellbore instability due to shale swelling and fluid loss of drilling mud is the main challenge faced by the oil and gas industry. Herein, we successfully demonstrated the positive impact of newly developed single-walled carbon nanotubes/polyvinylpyrrolidone (SWCNTs/PVP) nanocomposites on the drilling efficiency of water-based muds (WBMs). By adopting a standardized sonication technique, we achieved highly dispersed and uniform distribution of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) within the matrix of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). SWCNTs provided the required mechanical strength and hydrophobicity, while PVP acted as a binder, filler, and dispersion medium. The surface morphology of shales was compared before and after modification with SWCNTs/PVP nanocomposites. The moisture adsorption/repellent characteristics of the shales were predicted by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The dispersion stability of synthesized SWCNTs/PVP nanocomposite with bentonite clay in the presence of water was also recorded for 24 h. The drilling mud modified with 5-SWCNTs/PVP nanocomposite demonstrates 23% reduction in fluid loss. The inhibition stability and swelling rate of shales were systematically investigated and compared with water, KCl, unmodified mud, and commercial shale inhibitor. The comparison indicates that the modified drilling mud having 5-SWCNTs/PVP composite showed the highest dispersion recovery (89.5%) and the lowest swelling rate (21.6%). The synthesized nanocomposite not only forms a protective layer on the shale surface to hinder the access of water but also offers structural stability to the drilling mud. Improved swelling inhibition, fluid loss control, and long-term stability of shale against reactive fluid, suggested that the modified WBM can be effectively utilized to control wellbore instability during drilling operations.|| Laboratory measurements of capillary pressure (P-c) and the electrical resistivity index (RI) of reservoir rocks are used to calibrate well logging tools and to determine reservoir fluid distribution. Significant studies on the methods and factors affecting these measurements in rocks containing oil, gas, and water are adequately reported in the literature. However, with the advent of chemical enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods, surfactants are mixed with injection fluids to generate foam to enhance the gas injection process. Foam is a complex and non-Newtonian fluid whose behavior in porous media is different from conventional reservoir fluids. As a result, the effect of foam onP(c)and the reliability of using known rock models such as the Archie equation to fit experimental resistivity data in rocks containing foam are yet to be ascertained. In this study, we investigated the effect of foam on the behavior of bothP(c)andRIcurves in sandstone and carbonate rocks using both porous plate and two-pole resistivity methods at ambient temperature. Our results consistently showed that for a given water saturation (S-w), theRIof a rock increases in the presence of foam than without foam. We found that, below a criticalS(w), the resistivity of a rock containing foam continues to rise rapidly. We argue, based on knowledge of foam behavior in porous media, that this criticalS(w)represents the regime where the foam texture begins to become finer, and it is dependent on the properties of the rock and the foam. Nonetheless, the Archie model fits the experimental data of the rocks but with resulting saturation exponents that are higher than conventional gas-water rock systems. The degree of variation in the saturation exponents between the two fluid systems also depends on the rock and fluid properties. A theory is presented to explain this phenomenon. We also found that foam affects the saturation exponent in a similar way as oil-wet rocks in the sense that they decrease the cross-sectional area of water available in the pores for current flow. Foam appears to have competing and opposite effects caused by the presence of clay, micropores, and conducting minerals, which tend to lower the saturation exponent at lowS(w). Finally, theP(c)curve is consistently lower in foam than without foam for the sameS(w).|| The enormous unconventional gas resources can make an effective contribution to the world's economy as conventional hydrocarbon reserves are depleting rapidly. Oil-producing countries can produce from unconventional gas resources in order to fulfill their local demands and export most of the oil produced. However, for production at economical flow rates, the reservoir volume needs to be increased after stimulation treatment, which is a big challenge for the industry. This study aims to provide a new stimulation technique after the hydraulic fracturing stimulation to increase the stimulated reservoir volume by creating localized fractures and connecting the existing fractures using thermochemical reagents. Thermochemical reagents generate heat and pressure that cause microscale fractures in tight reservoir formations, thus increasing the fracture complexity. Microscale fractures, in turn, increase the porosity and permeability, causing sweet spot creation near the fracture zone. A set of thermochemical reagents was used for flooding the samples under pressure and heat until an exothermic reaction took place. An integrated methodology was implemented to investigate the role of thermochemical stimulation on different rock types, including Scioto sandstone, Indiana limestone, and Berea sandstone, through routine core analysis and advanced spectroscopic analytical techniques, such as porosity, permeability, microcomputed tomographic (MCT) imaging, capillary pressures, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). In addition, ultrasonic velocity (compressional- and shear-wave) measurements were performed, and dynamic elastic parameters (Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus) were determined. The monitoring techniques exhibited significant changes in petrophysical, strength, and other mechanical properties in rock samples as a result of the exothermic reaction inside the core samples. The MCT images revealed microfractures in the core sample generated as a result of the thermochemical treatment. Post-treatment measurements exhibited a substantial increase in porosity and permeability. A reduction in capillary pressure was observed after the treatment. The consequence of this study is to introduce a new, economical, and practical approach to increase the stimulated reservoir volume. This new stimulation technique will assist in meeting the difficult challenges related to producing unconventional reservoirs. Thermochemical stimulation may create multidirectional microfractures within the reservoir that better enhance the effective permeability around the wellbore as compared to hydraulic fracturing stimulation. This new thermochemical stimulation is a promising technique for the Middle East, where water scarcity is a big problem. A huge amount of water currently being used for hydraulic fracturing treatment could be redirected for other purposes. The outcome will result in a tremendous enhancement to unconventional gas production.|| To recover the remaining oil after water flooding, amphoteric surfactant-sulfonated polymer (S-P) flooding has attracted attention as a tertiary oil recovery technique. Oil recovery by S-P flooding not only is influenced by reservoir heterogeneity but also depends on chemical adsorption and interactions of S-P solution with the surface of rocks. This paper presents comprehensive laboratory results related to the dynamic adsorption, resistance factor (RF), residual resistance factor (RRF), and adsorbed layer thickness of S-P solution on the surface of carbonate rocks. Three core flooding experiments were conducted. The S-P solution was composed of an amphoteric surfactant (0.2 wt %) and sulfonated polymer solution (0.2 wt %) in seawater. The S-P solution was injected until the effluent concentration reached the inlet concentration. Seawater was injected after S-P injection to displace S-P solution until the effluent concentration reduced to a minimum value or constant value for desorption study. Total organic carbon (TOC) and Hyamine methods were used to determine the adsorption of the polymer and surfactant, respectively. The individual amount of dynamic adsorption and the total amount of adsorption of S-P solution onto carbonate rock were determined and compared with the results of single adsorption of a surfactant solution published previously. The residual resistance factor, resistance factor, and adsorbed layer thickness of S-P solution on carbonate rocks were calculated based on the differential pressure before and after injecting the S-P solution. We found that the dynamic adsorption, RF, RRF, and adsorbed layer thickness of the S-P solution strongly depends on pore geometry or reservoir properties. Some of the relationships are proposed for the first time. The loss of injectivity and liquid permeability during S-P solution injection are evaluated in detail in this paper. This paper presents insights into the dynamic adsorption, residual resistance factor, resistance factor, adsorbed layer thickness, and injectivity of S-P solution on carbonate rocks with reservoir parameters, which could help in designing the chemical enhanced oil recovery process in carbonate reservoirs.|| Shale swelling during drilling operations causes many problems mainly related to wellbore instability. The oil-based muds (OBMs) are very effective in controlling the swelling potential of clay-rich shale formation, but their environmental concerns and the economic aspects curtail their usage. In the application of water-based mud (WBM), it is mixed with various swelling inhibitors such as inorganic salts (KCl and NaCl), sodium silicate, polymers, and amines of various types. The above-mentioned materials are however afflicted by some limitations in terms of their toxicity, their effect on drilling mud rheology, and their limited tolerance toward temperature and oil contamination. In this study, we investigated a novel hybrid aqueous alkali alumino silicate (AAAS) as a shale swelling inhibitor in WBM. The AAAS is a mixture of sodium, aluminum, and silicon oxides. Experimental investigations were carried out using a linear swell meter, hot rolling and capillary suction timer, zeta-potential test, filtration test, and rheology test. The application of hybrid silicate as a swelling inhibitor was studied in two phases. In the first phase, only silicate solutions were prepared in deionized water at various ratios (1, 2, and 5%) and tested on sodium bentonite and shale samples containing high contents of kaolinite clay. Further testing on commonly used inhibitors such as KCl and sodium silicate solutions was conducted for comparative purposes. In the second phase, different drilling mud formulations consisting of various percentages of AAAS were mixed and tested on original shale samples. It was observed that the novel silicate-based mix proved to be a strong shale swelling inhibitor. Its inhibition performance was better as compared to the sodium silicate solution and KCl solution. It not only inhibits shale swelling but also acts as a shale stabilizer due to its high adsorption on the shale surface, which prevents the shale/water reactivity, makes the shale formation stronger, and prevents caving.|| One of the major challenges for the oil industry in the 21st century is to get the desired surfactants that are soluble in high saline water (220, 000 ppm) and stable at high temperature (100 degrees C). Most commercial surfactants suffering due to hydrolysis at high temperature and the monovalent and divalent reservoir ions leads to surfactant precipitation. In order to address these issues, a new series of cationic gemini surfactants with a different number of aromatic rings in the spacer group as well as different counter ions were synthesized and characterized with the aid of MALDI-TOF MS, FTIR, H-1 NMR, and C-13 NMR spectroscopy. The effect of number of phenyl aromatic rings in the spacer and counterions on thermal and surface properties was determined. Thermogravimetric results showed the decomposition temperature of all the gemini surfactant near to 300 degrees C which is larger than the existing oilfield temperature (>= 100 degrees C). The insertion of ethoxy units between the lipophilic tail and lipophobic headgroup resulted in good solubility of cationic gemini surfactants in high saline and normal water without cloudiness or precipitation. The critical micelle concentration and the corresponding surface tension were lower for gemini surfactants containing bromide counterions compared to the surfactants containing chloride counterions. The gemini surfactants containing two aromatic phenyl rings in the spacer have lower critical micelle concentration compared to the gemini surfactants with one phenyl ring. The properties of the synthesized cationic gemini surfactants mark them a material of choice for high salinity/temperature reservoirs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, several challenges including high cost of steam generation, low heat transfer efficiency and/or heat loss, geotechnical and environmental issues are threatening its sustainability. In-situ generation of steam and nitrogen gas through injection of certain exothermic chemical reactants (thermochemical fluids - TCF) can be employed to alleviate these challenges. The present investigation focuses on experimental, numerical simulation and economic studies to assess this novel technique, and to compare its performance with those of conventional steam injection methods.

Due to the high complexity of the state assignment problem and the ineffectiveness of existing deterministic algorithms in generating good solutions, evolutionary algorithms can be employed to obtain more effective state assignment solutions. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic tabu search (PTS) state assignment algorithm that is employed for the optimization of area and power of sequential circuits. The proposed algorithm is based on tabu search with the addition of exploiting code swap probabilities to prune the search space more effectively. Code swap probabilities are updated dynamically during the execution of the algorithm in such a way that code swaps that result in relatively inferior solutions will be assigned lower probabilities while those that result in good solutions will be assigned higher probabilities. In addition, tabu list size is changed dynamically during execution to help the algorithm get out of local minima. Based on experimental results, we show that the proposed PTS state assignment algorithm is more effective than all existing state assignment algorithms as it generates state assignment solutions with significantly lower area and power.|| Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are mainly data-driven networks adopted to improve the Internet of Things (IoT) in terms of data throughput, energy efficiency, and self-management. Improving the data lifespan of WSN impacts the performance of the IoT. Achieving data reliability in applications of WSNs deployed in harsh environments is challenging due to the extreme constraints in resources of sensor nodes (SNs). Motivated by the inexpensive infrastructure of WSNs, a number of distributed storage systems have been proposed focusing on achieving data survivability rather than network reliability. In this article, we focus on data storage at the things layer (wireless sensors). We evaluate the performance of a number of distributed data storage systems (DDSSs) over WSN running over the ZigBee MAC protocol. Based on our findings, we introduce a new efficient-energy data dissemination scheme called data survivability with energy efficiency (DSwEE) that outperforms the existing schemes. We compare DSwEE against two prominent protocols in data storage, namely, decentralized erasure code for data survivability (DEC-DS) and decentralized erasure code encode-and-disseminate (DEC-EaD). Results show that DSwEE achieves better performance than both DEC-DS and DEC-EaD in terms of the energy consumption and data recoverability for localized failures, which improves the lifespan of the network.|| Peer-to-peer (P2P) content distribution and file sharing systems aim to facilitate the dissemination of large files over unreliable networks. Network coding is a transmission technique that has captured the interest of researchers because of its ability to increase throughput and robustness of the network, and decrease the download time. In this survey paper, we extensively summarize, assess, compare, and classify the most recently used techniques to improve P2P content distribution systems performance using network coding. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first comprehensive survey that specifically focuses on the performance of network coding based P2P file sharing systems.|| Internet of Things (IoT), the state-of-the-art technology, has recently started to enhance different industries and services. One of the few that are impacted by this technology are medicine and healthcare industries. The application of IoT in healthcare, in particular, is a major field attracting many researchers nowadays. The aim of this paper is to propose an IoT based system for monitoring multiple diseases using Cisco packet tracer tool. The achieve this aim, the system is divided into two parts. The first part deals with data collection and processing from sensors and microcontrollers. The second part deals with offered services such as disease diagnosis, medicine administration, and emergency responses. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system, three diseases are consider including hypertension, glaucoma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is also possible to incorporate other diseases.|| Visible light communication (VLC) is a short-range wireless access technology based on the dual use of illumination structure. The frequency-selective characteristics of VLC channels motivate the use of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). In addition, the presence of multiple light sources in most indoor spaces makes multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) communication techniques a natural solution for VLC systems. In this paper, we investigate the design of an adaptive MIMO OFDM system. Specifically, we propose adaptive bit and power loading for a direct current-biased OFDM VLC system with MIMO mode switching between repetition coding and spatial multiplexing. We formulate the adaptive algorithm design as an optimization problem where we aim to maximize spectral efficiency through the proper selection of modulation order, power level, and MIMO mode, while satisfying a targeted bit error rate. To solve the underlying NP-hard problems, we use a simulated annealing heuristic. We present Monte Carlo simulation results for a typical indoor setting and illustrate the performance improvements through link adaptation.|| In this paper, we propose a self-organising and cooperative approach that utilises the coexistence of different communication technologies (Bluetooth, WiFi and 3/4G) in smartphones. Neighbouring smartphones are cooperatively group themselves to form multiple clusters. The cluster head (CH) of each cluster uses its positioning and internet services to send tracking data to the server for all its cluster members, while other members use only Bluetooth to communicate locally and report to the CH. The proposed algorithm assures distributed and fairness among all nodes. Based on the power consumption analysis, the clustering problem is modelled as a mixed integer programming model (MIP) then solved by the algebraic modelling system GAMS. Extensive simulations have been conducted to evaluate the proposed clustering algorithm. The results show that the proposed solution achieves substantial improvement in terms of energy saving compared to contemporary algorithms, while it guarantees fairness.|| The traditional method to solve nondeterministic-polynomial-time (NP)-hard optimization problems is to apply meta-heuristic algorithms. In contrast, Deep Q Learning (DQL) uses memory of experience and deep neural network (DNN) to choose steps and progress towards solving the problem. The dynamic time-division multiple access (DTDMA) scheme is a viable transmission method in visible light communication (VLC) systems. In DTDMA systems, the time-slots of the users are adjusted to maximize the spectral efficiency (SE) of the system. The users in a VLC network have different channel gains because of their physical locations, and the use of variable time-slots can improve the system performance. In this work, we propose a Markov decision process (MDP) model of the DTDMA-based VLC system. The MDP model integrates into deep Q learning (DQL) and provides information to it according to the behavior of the VLC system and the objective to maximize the SE. When we use the proposed MDP model in deep Q learning with experienced replay algorithm, we provide the light emitting diode (LED)-based transmitter an autonomy to solve the problem so it can adjust the time-slots of users using the data collected by device in the past. The proposed model includes definitions of the state, actions, and rewards based on the specific characteristics of the problem. Simulations show that the performance of the proposed DQL method can produce results that are competitive to the well-known metaheuristic algorithms, such as Simulated Annealing and Tabu search algorithms.|| Filters are the fastest among the different types of feature selection methods. They employ metrics from information theory, such as mutual information (MI), Joint-MI (JMI), and minimal redundancy and maximal relevance (mRMR). The determination of the optimal feature selection set is an NP-hard problem. This work proposes the engineering of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) in which the fitness of solutions consists of two terms. The first is a feature selection metric such as MI, JMI, and mRMR, and the second term is the overlapping-coefficient that accounts for the diversity in the GA population. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can return multiple good quality solutions that also have minimal overlap with each other. Numerous solutions provide significant benefits when the test data contains none or missing values. Experiments were conducted using two publicly available time-series datasets. The feature sets are also applied to perform forecasting using a simple Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, and the solution quality of the forecasting using different feature sets is analyzed. The proposed algorithm was compared with a popular optimization tool 'Basic Open-source Nonlinear Mixed INteger programming' (BONMIN), and a recent feature selection algorithm 'Conditional Mutual Information Considering Feature Interaction' (CMFSI). The experiments show that the multiple solutions found by the proposed method have good quality and minimal overlap.|| Motion planning of agents is one of the fundamental research problems in autonomous systems. An important aspect of motion planning is collision avoidance of the agents with other agents and obstacles that are present in the agent's environment. Typically, the collision avoidance constraints are non-linear and non-convex. Thus, the mathematical formulation of motion planning of multiple agents, in the presence of other agents and obstacles, is NP-Hard. In this paper, a novel heuristic approach for motion planning in multi-agent dynamic environment is proposed. The approach is computationally cheap, and can be launched locally on each agent for the trajectory planning. The applicability of the proposed approach is illustrated by numerical examples considering uncertainty in the environment. Detailed discussions on the performance of the proposed approach are presented. Finally, the observations on the key characteristics of the proposed approach are summarized.|| In this paper, a game-theoretical autonomous decision-making approach for efficient deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a multi-level and multi-dimensional assisted network is analyzed. The UAVs have directional antennas that work as wireless stations, which provide the best coverage for multiple ground mobile/fixed users. In general, UAVs work in a cooperative manner for achieving the suitable deployment with the optimal coverage values for the candidate region. In this paper, a game theory concept is used and the payoff function for each UAV is defined based on the coverage probability value, which depends on the altitude and the characteristic of antennas in the UAVs. We introduce a mathematical formulation for evaluating the payoff values based on a set of actions for each UAV, and the Nash equilibrium for this kind of game. This approach works in an intelligent way based on the interactions between the UAVs and their neighbors in a connected network and it might work even in harsh environments. In order to minimize interference, the UAVs' altitudes are adjusted based on the antennas and other deployment requirements (i.e. search and surveillance purposes) by using the minimum number of UAVs to cover the candidate geographical region. The simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves the maximum coverage value, converges fast with the environmental changes based on the power levels, and robust for failure scenarios. Finally, we compare our approach against one of the traditional approaches called Collaborative Visual Area Coverage Approach (CVACA) based on uniform coverage quality. The simulation results show that the game approach outperforms the traditional approach in term of the coverage value and the computational time.|| This article focuses on cyber-physical systems involving a set of robots and sensors that are interconnected through wireless links. In applications that operate in harsh environments, wireless sensors and robot networks (WSRNs) may suffer simultaneous failures, which lead to partitioning the WSRN into unconnected subnetworks. The loss of connectivity often leads to degrade performance and inability to fulfill the application mission. To address this issue, several proposals have been made in the literature where node mobility is exploited to re-establish connectivity. These proposals, however, focus on minimizing the number of mobile nodes and the traveled distance cost while ignoring important factors, such as robot battery level, network lifetime, and environmental conditions, that may limit or hinder the whole recovery process. To overcome these limitations, we present a distributed node repositioning algorithm based on fuzzy logic. We evaluate our approach via extensive simulations and prototype experiments using Khepera IV robots. The results demonstrate superior performance to that of contemporary approaches.|| Cloud computing is an essential technology for the future of the Information Technology (IT) industry. However, the cloud security level is identified as the biggest challenge facing cloud providers and a major concern for cloud adopters. Economic Denial of Sustainability (EDoS) attack is one of the major threats targeting the cloud. The EDoS attack exploits the cloud elasticity and auto scaling features to charge a cloud adopter bill an excessive amount of cost leading to large-scale service withdrawal or bankruptcy. A novel reactive approach referred to as the EDoS Attack Defense Shell (EDoS-ADS) is proposed to mitigate EDoS attacks while taking into account most of the existing mitigation techniques drawbacks. Specifically, the EDoS-ADS has the ability to identify the legitimacy of clients even if they belong to a Network Address Translation (NAT) based network. Thus, EDoS-ADS is the first known technique that effectively prevents an EDoS attack from blocking an entire NAT-based network from accessing the cloud. The EDoS-ADS effectiveness in terms of response time, CPU utilization, throughput, and cost is evaluated using a CloudSim simulator. The simulation results show that EDoS-ADS outperforms other mitigation techniques, and successfully differentiates between legitimate and attacker clients even when they belong to the same NAT-based network.|| Confidentiality in storing and transmitting images is needed for different fields such as medical, military, online personal albums, confidential communications and video conferencing, etc. Many image encryption techniques are proposed to ensure confidentiality of data. Digital images are different from text data as they have more data, higher data redundancy and correlation between image pixels. In wireless sensor networks (WSN), many encryption techniques are proposed. Sensor nodes have limited resources in memory, energy and processing capabilities; therefore, the proposed techniques must consider these limitations. However, most of the proposed techniques are not applicable for digital images due to image structure and size; therefore, the traditional cryptosystems can not be applied on WSN. In this paper, the following two digital images transformation techniques: (1) discrete cosine transform and (2) discrete wavelet transform are used to propose digital images encryption techniques for WSN.|| Many diversified services can be offered by smart objects, referred to herein by nodes, in low-power and lossy networks (LLNs) contributing to the Internet of Things (IoT). A distributed naming and registration system, complying with the Internet protocol standard, is needed for unique identification of these nodes and their provided services in many areas such as monitoring and remote control. Due to the high expected number of IoT nodes, manual configuration is not practical, and an efficient auto-configuration mechanism is essential. Although the multicast domain name system (mDNS) is the most common distributed naming protocol nowadays, it is not optimized for constrained LLN nodes in IoT. This work proposes enhanced mDNS (E-mDNS) which augments mDNS with three proposed enhancements: the persistent-based selection stage, the simultaneous start-up enhancement, and the announcement suppression mechanism. Using the Cooja emulation platform, we evaluate both the mDNS and E-mDNS for a wide range of conditions and network sizes, and produce a large array of performance figures that includes number of control packets, energy consumption for CPU and radio transmissions, memory footprint, and others. Through the evaluation of the fairness index for a wide range of number of nodes, we demonstrate that E-mDNS provides better load balancing for the collection of nodes in the network relative to mDNS. Furthermore, results indicate that while E-mDNS produces a memory footprint in RAM that is only 4.2% more than that for mDNS, E-mDNS manages to significantly reduce the number of control packets by an average of 34.8% for the considered range of network size. Accordingly, the corresponding reduction in energy consumption for radio transmissions and CPU is 46.7% and 47.5%, respectively. The evaluation shows that these reductions are greater for larger number of nodes.|| According to Object Management Group organization, Data Distribution Service (DDS) middleware is the leading technology for Industrial Internet of Things (lIoT). Therefore, using DDS-based middleware for Wireless Sensor/Actuator Networks (WSAN) will extremely ease the development and integration of WSAN applications into IloT, which has an effective impact on improving the productivity and saving the cost. However, applying such technology over WSAN significantly affects the energy consumption. In this work, an energy-aware middleware for WSAN is developed based on DDS standard, which is called EATDDS. Furthermore, developing this middleware leads to a major enhancement into TOSSIM simulator; in which an Online Energy Model (OEM) is developed to make TOSSIM capable of developing and testing energy-aware protocols. The model is validated by comparing it against POWERTOSSIM. Our results show that EATDDS is efficient and can be accommodated with limited system resources. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

A network composes of many connections, and each connection needs a frequency from the spectrum. The assignment of frequencies to the transmitters should satisfy a set of constraints. The constraints specify the separation which is necessary between frequencies of different transmitters. Violation of constraints creates interference. The goal of the FS-FA problem is to find an assignment of frequencies for the transmitters, which has minimum interference. The proposed heuristic has two main components: a local search heuristic and a compound move. The local search heuristic employs one-change moves (i.e., a move that changes the frequency of one transmitter at a time). It also employs a lookup table that classifies all possible one-change moves as positive or negative. The local search heuristic chooses positive/negative moves until it traps in a locally minimal solution. The compound-move operation shifts the local search to a new location in the search space. We can repeatedly apply the local search and compound move for many iterations. The proposed heuristic has been evaluated on the same benchmarks as used by others in the recently published literature. We have compared our algorithm with two existing tabu-search-based algorithms: dynamic-list-based tabu search (DTS) (Montemanni et al. in IEEE Trans Veh Technol 52(4):891-901, 2003. 10.1109/TVT.2003.810976) and heuristic manipulation technique-based TS (Montemanni and Smith in Comput Oper Res 37(3):543-551, 2010. 10.1016/j.cor.2008.08.006) (HMT). The solution quality of the proposed algorithm is found to be better than or equal to the HMT and DTS in 88% and 79% of test problems, respectively.|| Wireless sensor network (WSN) information network in Smart Grid is envisioned to handle diversified traffic such as real-time sensitive data and non-real-time traffic. Therefore, QoS routing protocol in smart grid network is essential. Ticket-based routing (TBR) protocol is a promising protocol because it can select routes based on several desired metrics, for example route cost and delay. However, the original TBR suffers the need for transmitting a huge number of tickets to probe the sensor network and discover the path cost and delay. Genetic algorithm can be used to minimize the number of tickets as well as discovery messages overhead. In this work, we implement genetic algorithm (GA-TBR) at the source sensor node to collect the state information inside the WSN environment of Smart Grid and hence optimize the selection of routes to ensure the required QoS. Extensive simulation experiments have been conducted to investigate the performance of GA-TBR. The simulation results have shown that with few tickets, the proposed algorithm is able to select routes with minimum possible delay and shows 28% improvement compared to ad hoc on demand distance vector routing (AODV) protocol.|| Autonomous robot deployment is very attracting feature especially inside unknown area. Virtual force (VF) technique appears as one of the prominent approaches to performing multirobot deployment autonomously. However, most of the existing VF-based approaches lack purposeful deployment. In this work, we present a Cooperative Virtual Force Robot Deployment (COVER) technique. Our approach modifies the original VF approach to overcome this problem and considers the mission requirements such as the number of required robots in each locality (e.g., landmarks are distributed, and each needs a specific number of robots in its vicinity). In addition, COVER expedites the deployment process by establishing a cooperative relation between robots and neighboring landmarks. Extensive simulation experiments have been carried out to assess the performance of COVER along with Hungarian deployment method (a centralized approach), the basic virtual force, and full virtual force. A proof of concept experiment using TurtleBot robots is presented as well to show real implementation of COVER. The simulation and experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of COVER for several performance factors such as total traveled distance, total exchanged messages, and total deployment time.|| A new scheme using field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to secure Internet of Things (IoT) data processing in public clouds against various attacks (including attacks from insiders) is proposed. The proposed scheme supports various business models involving multiple parties and allow the data owner to give temporary access to IoT data to specific clients at a public market place (the cloud). The scheme achieves perfect forward secrecy, provides FPGA authentication, a secure way to establish a symmetric session key between the on-cloud FPGA, the IoT device and the client, and allows user's configuration integrity check while running in the cloud FPGA. A symmetric proxy re-encryption (PRE) scheme is used to support the publish/subscribe mode of operation of IoT. A complete prototype has been implemented to show the feasibility of the proposed scheme. Formal verification of the proposed protocol verified that it does not have any vulnerabilities. Experimental results showed that an FPGA implementation of the proposed PRE was 6x faster than the SW implementation in transforming a ciphertext of size 1 GB.|| The pipeline leakage problem is a very challenging and critical issue. Solving this problem will save the nation a lot of money, resources and more importantly, it will save the environment. This paper discusses the state of the art of leak detection systems (LDSs) and data fusion approaches that are applicable to pipeline monitoring. A comparison of LDSs is performed based on well-defined criteria. We have classified and critically reviewed these techniques. A thorough analysis and comparison of all the recent works have been provided.|| Leakage in oil, gas, or water pipeline networks is a global concern; its impact has serious consequences on the ecosystem. Several solutions have been either proposed or in service for monitoring the pipeline networks. These proposals, however, are expensive, time-consuming, and most are intrusive which necessitate interrupting ongoing operations. The advances in sensing technologies made it possible to build affordable non-intrusive solutions. However, building a sensor network that is able to continuously monitor the pipeline, detect, and report any anomaly poses a number of challenges: node placement, energy saving, data flow, throughput, and just to mention a few. This paper presents an adaptive clustering algorithm for grouping and deploying multiple sensors along the whole pipeline. By using this algorithm, each group of sensors selects adaptively a cluster head, which aggregates the incoming traffic from its members and then delivers it to the next cluster head and so on until it reaches the base station. The simulation and prototype-based experiments' results have shown significant energy saving compared to contemporary approaches.|| In today's Internet, killer network services and applications, such as video and audio streaming, network storage, and online video games, are pushing the network infrastructure resources to the edge. By design and for the most part, the Internet is the best offer delivery ecosystem with little or no end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees. Even, frameworks, such as IntServ and DiffServ that were designed and implemented to provide QoS guarantees, still fail to solve this problem at a wide scale. Software-defined networking (SDN) is a fast emerging networking paradigm that promises to provide end-to-end QoS guaranteeing by offering greater network flexibility, abstraction, control, and programmability to network resources. In this paper, we review, survey, and discuss the current state of the art on QoS provisioning in the area of SDN, with respect to applying the concept of autonomic computing (AC) to automatically support, provision, monitor, and maintain QoS requirements. This paper includes in-depth classification, taxonomy, and comparative analysis for the autonomic-based QoS provisioning in accordance with the famous influential and widely adopted the monitor-analyze-plan-execute-knowledge (MAPE-K) IBM architectural model for autonomic computing.|| In this paper, we consider a visible light communication (VLC) system with direct current-biased orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DC-OFDM) and investigate resource allocation for a multi-user environment. Based on the user satisfaction index as a function of data rate, we aim to optimally determine the allocation of the users to different LEDs (acting as access points) and 0I-DM subcarriers. We propose a simulated annealing-based heuristic to maximize the average user satisfaction index. In an effort to make the proposed solution practically feasible, the runtime of the proposed heuristic is kept less than the channel coherence time, whose value is in order of tens of milliseconds. We evaluate the performance of the proposed heuristic algorithm in different scenarios that vary in the number of users, the number of LEDs, and the separation between users. Our results demonstrate that the proposed heuristic outperforms other well-known heuristics (such as standard simulated annealing, iterative greedy, particle swarm optimization, and tabu search) while achieving good quality solutions within a short execution time, i.e., 40-80 ms.|| Caching and cloud control are new technologies that were suggested to improve the performance of future wireless networks. Fog radio access networks (F-RANs) have been recently proposed to further improve the throughput of future cellular networks by exploiting these two technologies. In this paper, we study the cloud offloading gains achieved by utilizing F-RANs that admit enhanced remote radio heads (eRRHs) with heterogeneous wireless technologies, namely, LIE and WiFi. This F-RAN architecture thus allows widely proliferating smart phone devices to receive two packets simultaneously from their inbuilt LIE and WiFi interfaces. We first formulate the general cloud base station (CBS) offloading problem as an optimization problem over a dual conflict graph, which is proven to be intractable. Thus, we formulate an online version of the CBS offloading problem in heterogeneous F-RANs as a weighted graph coloring problem and show it is NP-hard. We then devise a novel opportunistic network coding (ONC)-assisted heuristic solution to this problem, which divides it into two subproblems and solves each subproblem independently. We derive lower bounds on the online and aggregate CBS offloading performances of our proposed scheme and analyze its complexity. The simulations quantify the gains achieved by our proposed heterogeneous F-RAN solution compared with the traditional homogeneous F-RAN scheme and the derived lower bounds in terms of both CBS offloading and throughput.|| A novel platform for launching and using field-programmable gate arrays (FPFA) custom computing machines (CCMs) in clouds and data centers is proposed. Based on a developed FPGA virtualization scheme, it allows users to create independent computing services on network-attached standalone FPGAs. The interface of the virtual FPGA (vFPGA)-based CCM is automatically generated by a virtualization layer and based on the user's specifications. An FPGA hypervisor has been developed that can be easily integrated with any cloud management tool. It allows the users to launch/use/tear down vFPGA-based CCMs in a similar manner to conventional virtual machines (VMs). A complete prototype of the proposed platform has been realized and tested with a streamed image processing application. Its performance was 3-4x and similar to 1.4-2.4x times better than an SW implementation on a VM and a powerful server, respectively. Compared with other platforms for FPGA attachment to a cloud or datacenter, the proposed platform has relatively low overhead in terms of FPGA resources while providing the highest level of abstraction and virtualization.|| Monitoring oil, gas and water pipeline networks is a critical problem; its impact has serious consequences on the ecosystem. Placing sensors that monitor these pipelines is a challenging problem. Naturally, a linear topology is adopted which requires careful attention in placing sensors in order to minimise energy consumption, maximise network lifetime and ensure robustness against anomaly. In this work, we have studied two existing greedy node placement approaches via simulation and experimental analysis. First, we have validated experimentally the 31 power levels of CC2420 TelosB chipon and their corresponding transmission ranges. Having more power-level resolution provides more flexible power assignment, which yields less energy consumption and longer lifetime compared to traditional 8 power levels. Second, extensive simulation and real experiments have been conducted. The results demonstrate a considerable drop in power consumption, which can reach 73% and 23% extension in the network lifetime when all 31 power levels are adopted.|| Many important and critical applications use wireless sensor/actuator networks (WSAN). These applications are spanning widely that range in several environments, including industrial, commercial, and residential. Most of these applications need a certain level of real-time communication in addition to reliable data delivery service. Data distribution service (DDS) is a known standard for supporting real-time distributed systems based on the publish/subscribe model. The DDS specification offers two disparate quality-of-service levels of data reliability, namely: best-effort and fully-reliable. TinyDDS is a lightweight and partial porting of DDS middleware to sensor-based platforms, specifically for platforms with lim",|| A Probabilistic Tabu Search State Assignment Algorithm for Area and Power Optimization of Sequential Circuits|| A Novel Approach for Efficient Management of Data Lifespan of IoT Devices|| Survey of Network Coding Based P2P File Sharing in Large Scale Networks|| Internet of Things based multiple disease monitoring and health improvement system|| Joint bit and power loading for adaptive MIMO OFDM VLC systems|| Self-organising cooperative clustering protocol for tracking and monitoring|| Deep Q-Learning Based Optimization of VLC Systems With Dynamic Time-Division Multiplexing|| Genetic Algorithm for the Mutual Information-Based Feature Selection in Univariate Time Series Data|| Heuristic Approach for Real-Time Multi-Agent Trajectory Planning Under Uncertainty|| A game theoretic approach of deployment a multiple UAVs for optimal coverage|| Energy-Aware Connectivity Restoration Mechanism for Cyber-Physical Systems of Networked Sensors and Robots|| EDoS-ADS: An Enhanced Mitigation Technique Against Economic Denial of Sustainability (EDoS) Attacks|| Digital image encryption techniques for wireless sensor networks using image transformation methods: DCT and DWT|| Traffic-aware auto-configuration protocol for service oriented low-power and lossy networks in IoT|| EATDDS: Energy-aware middleware for wireless sensor and actuator networks|| A Neighborhood Search-Based Heuristic for the Fixed Spectrum Frequency Assignment Problem|| Ticket-based QoS routing optimization using genetic algorithm for WSN applications in smart grid|| Cooperative Robot Deployment: Simulation and Real Experimental Analysis|| FPGA-Based Symmetric Re-Encryption Scheme to Secure Data Processing for Cloud-Integrated Internet of Things|| Pipeline Leak Detection Systems and Data Fusion: A Survey|| Cluster-Based Node Placement Approach for Linear Pipeline Monitoring|| A Survey on Autonomic Provisioning and Management of QoS in SDN Networks|| Resource Allocation for Visible Light Communication Systems Using Simulated Annealing Based on a Problem-Specific Neighbor Function|| Opportunistic Network Coding-Assisted Cloud Offloading in Heterogeneous Fog Radio Access Networks|| Cloud-Based FPGA Custom Computing Machines for Streaming Applications|| Node placement approaches for pipelines monitoring: simulation and experimental analysis|| Reliable Middleware for Wireless Sensor-Actuator Networks|| FPGA-Based Accelerators of Deep Learning Networks for Learning and Classification: A Review|| A comparative study of texture attributes for characterizing subsurface structures in seismic volumes|| A platform for FPGA virtualization in clouds and data centers|| FBNoC: FPGA-based network on chip emulator for full-system architectural simulation of many-core systems|| Double Modular Redundancy (DMR) Based Fault Tolerance Technique for Combinational Circuits|| Engineering simulated evolution for integrated power optimization in data centers|| A Novel Spectrally Efficient Asynchronous Multi-Channel MAC Using a Half-Duplex Transceiver for Wireless Networks|| Network-Coded Macrocell Offloading in Femtocaching-Assisted Cellular Networks|| Software-defined networking approach for enhanced evolved packet core network|| Empirical Study on Use of Online Social Networking Sites in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia|| An Optimization Heuristic Based on Non-Dominated Sorting and Tabu Search for the Fixed Spectrum Frequency Assignment Problem|| Data delivery in wireless sensor networks with uncontrollable mobile nodes,"|| State assignment;

It is divided into two main parts. In the first part, the set of n x n e-matrices (real constant row-sum matrices) is partitioned into equivalence classes which are called e-similarity classes. The relationships between the spectra of different matrices belonging to the same equivalence class, as well as their left and generalized left eigenspaces, are discussed. In the second part, the results obtained in the first part are applied to improve the location of eigenvalues of e-matrices. Associated localization Gershgorin regions of the so-called second type are obtained. A number of examples are provided.|| Background: Morbid obesity is a very serious medical condition and immediate treatment is necessary to control and maintains healthy body mass index to avoid further health problems. The purpose of this investigation was to find out the effect of combined aerobics and resistance-training protocol on coronary heart disease (CHD) variables among morbid obese males. Method: A group of (N=40) participants was selected randomly to take part in this investigation during the year 2019. The age of the participants was in the range between 19-23 years, combined training (aerobic cum resistance) protocol engaged for 12 weeks, 40 minutes of training per session and two days in a week. These participants were segregated into two groups namely Group-A (N=20, combined aerobic cum resistance training group), Group-B (N=20 control group). The combined aerobic cum resistance training employed on group-A and no specific training was advise to control group-B. The pre and post-test considered for the coronary heart disease test as follows; Body mass index (BMI), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol, percent body fat, lean body fat and resting pulse rate. To compare the mean differences from pre to post test, mean, S.D, and t-test was computed with the help of SPSS software. Result and Discussion: Analysis of results after training programs revealed that experimental group in body mass index reduces (from 44.56 +/- 5.36 to 40.31 +/- 2.94, BMI, P<0.00), HDL improves (from 54.65 +/- 1.92 to 56.20P<0.00), LDL improves (from 120.41 +/- 6.34 to 109.90 +/- 6.80, P<0.00), total cholesterol changes (from 212.39 +/- 7.79 to 200.14 +/- 8.84,P<0.00), percent body fat improves (from 23.97 +/- 2.49 to 20.84 +/- 1.49,P<0.00), lean body mass improves (from 75.48 +/- 2.03 to 78.60 +/- 2.42,P<0.00), Resting pulse rate improves (from 73.95 +/- 3.80 to 71.30 +/- 4.19,P<0.00). Moreover, control group had not shown any improvement in the selected components, such as BMI, HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, percent body fat, lean body fat and resting pulse rate, and which is not significant. Conclusion: It is concluded that the combined training protocol on coronary heart diseases variables among morbid obese males had shown significant improvement from pre to post-test. Moreover, control group had not shown any significant improvement.|| In this paper, we are concerned with the decay rate of the solution of a viscoelastic plate equation with infinite memory and logarithmic nonlinearity. We establish an explicit and general decay rate results with imposing a minimal condition on the relaxation function. In fact, we assume that the relaxation function h satisfies h '(t)<=-xi(t)H(h(t)),t >= 0, where the functions xi and H satisfy some conditions. Our proof is based on the multiplier method, convex properties, logarithmic inequalities, and some properties of integro-differential equations. Moreover, we drop the boundedness assumption on the history data, usually made in the literature. In fact, our results generalize, extend, and improve earlier results in the literature.|| This study evaluates changes in power and strength after implementing two different models of 9-week strength training in elite women's football players. A group of 13 players (age 20.2 +/- 3.3 years, body mass 57.2 +/- 3.7 kg, height 163.6 +/- 5.3 cm, VO2max 45.2 +/- ml/min) underwent either a complex (the intermittent load type) or combined (the maximal strength and dynamic method) model of training. The training load was tailored to each athlete. Results showed that the complex model of training improved power (10 W/kg, p = 0.006) and height of vertical jump (5.3 cm, p = 0.001), weight of 1 Repeat Maximum (1RM) which was (5.8 kg, p = 0.015), power and speed in the acceleration phase of barbell half squats (BHS) at weights from 20 to 60 kg, and the number of repetitions in BHS (10.3%, p = 0.012). The combined model of training improved the time of shuttle run (0.44 s, p = 0.000), weight of 1RM in BHS (9.6kg, p = 0.000) and BP (4 kg, p = 0.000), power in the acceleration phase of BHS at weights from 50 to 60 kg, the number of repetitions in BP (14.3%, p = 0.000), BHS (9.4%, p = 0.002), barbell bench pulls (11.9%, p = 0.002) and sit-ups (7.7%, p = 0.001). These findings indicate that the complex model of training improves explosive abilities, whereas the combined model is effective for developing strength at weights close to players' 1RM and for repeatedly overcoming resistance. Therefore, coaches should choose the training model based on the needs of individual players.|| Introduction: Learning is a continuous process. Learning resistance training professionally and training under qualified instructor is very important for the outcome of utmost benefits of fitness and health. Motor fitness is vital for the athletes and it is the ability of an athlete to achieve efficaciously in their respective sports field. Resistance training is beneficial for all athletes and important part of the athlete's training program (K.Azeem, 2014). The purpose of this investigation was to find out the learning outcomes of resistance training on motor fitness performance among young students. Method: A group of (N=60) subjects was selected randomly to participate in this study. The age of the participants was in the range of 18-24 years, resistance-training program employed for 12 weeks, two days in a week, 45 minutes of training per session. The subjects were segregated into two groups namely Group-A (n=30, experimental group), Group -B (n=30 control group). The resistance training employed on experimental group and control group not given any specific training. The pre and post tests were considered for this study was motor fitness components are as follows; speed (50M sprint), balance (stork balance test), explosive power (standing broad jump), agility (Illinois agility test). To compare the mean differences from pre to post test, mean, standard deviation, and t-test computed by the help of statistica software. Results & Discussion: Twelve weeks of resistance training protocol had revealed significant performance from pre to post-test among the participants with regard to motor fitness variables with mean, standard deviation and P-value i.e. 50M Sprint, (8.49,1.50) and (7.98,1.18), (P=0.12), balance (25.67, 10.35) and (35.50, 6.16), (P=0.00), Standing broad jump, (1.73,0.30) and (1.97,0.29), (P=0.01), Illinois agility run (20.55, 0.46) and (16.69, 0.72), (P=0.00). Conclusion: It is concluded that the influence of resistance training had shown significant performance among the young students with regard to the selected motor fitness test i.e. speed (50M sprint), balance (stork balance test), explosive power (standing broad jump), and agility (Illinois agility test) from pre to post test.|| Cumulative sum control charts that are based on the estimated control limits are extensively used in practice. Such control limits are often characterized by a Phase I estimation error. The presence of these errors can cause a change in the location and/or width of control limits resulting in a deprived performance of the control chart. In this study, we introduce a non-parametric Tukey's outlier detection model in the design structure of a two-sided cumulative sum (CUSUM) chart with estimated parameters for process monitoring. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we studied the estimation effect on the performance of the CUSUM chart in terms of the average run length and the standard deviation of the run length. We found the new design structure is more stable in the presence of outliers and requires fewer amounts of Phase I observations to stabilize the run-length performance. Finally, a numerical example and practical application of the proposed scheme are demonstrated using a dataset from healthcare surveillance where received signal strength of individuals' movement is the variable of interest. The implementation of classical CUSUM shows that a shift detection in Phase II that received signal strength data is indeed masked/delayed if there are outliers in Phase I data. On the contrary, the proposed chart omits the Phase I outliers and gives a timely signal in Phase II.|| In this paper, we consider a viscoelastic plate equation with a velocity-dependent material density and a logarithmic nonlinearity. Using the Faedo-Galaerkin approximations and the multiplier method, we establish the existence of the solutions of the problem and we prove an explicit and general decay rate result. These results extend and improve many results in the literature.|| The aim of this study was to discern the impact of complementary protein with additional food consumption (AFC) and exercise on ectomorphism and energy variables on anorexic males. Thirty seven participants, 19-25 years, body mass index (BMI) >18.5 kg/m(2) were allocated to complement protein with API plus strength training (Cl; n=10), protein with normal food intake (C2, n=8), and control group-3 (C-3 n = 19), The training lasted eight weeks (2 days x 40 M). C1 and C2 were administered with protein twice a week. The tests were BMI, body fat percentage, fat-free mass (FFM), and one-repetition max test in the leg press, chest press, and food intake (Fl). ANOVA was applied for age, height, BMI, and repeated measures for BM, %BF, FFM, LP, CP, and FT. The significance level was 0.05. One-way ANOVA revealed no changes for age, I-I, and BMI (P>005). ANOVA with repeated measures resulted in significant effects on time (P<0.05), groups (P<0,05), and interaction effect of time by groups (P <0.05) for BM, LP, CP, and FT. FFM showed significant effects on time (P <0.05) and groups (P <0.05) but no interaction effect on time by groups (P >0.05). The %BF showed no significant effects on time and groups (P >0.05) but there was a significant interaction effect on time by groups (P <0.05). The study indicated that underweight subjects could improve body mass and strength with the training protocol.

The aim of the study was to determine whether three sports in a PE course will help improve the health-related fitness of male university students. Material: Students from two universities participated in the study, with one university acting as a control group. There were two PE courses which students registered for: a football and volleyball (FVG, n=169) course and a badminton (BG, n=97) course. The students received basic training drills and competed with one another. The duration of the activities was 50 minutes sessions for eight weeks. The following tests were taken before and after eight weeks: Cooper test, sit-and-reach test, 60-s curl test, standing long jump test, and body mass index. Paired t-tests were used to compare the baseline and post data of each group. The Welch t-test, ANCOVA, and analysis of gains scores were used to compare each of the PE groups to the control group. ANCOVA was used to account for baseline differences, while analysis of gains scores was used whenever ANCOVA could not be used. The Vargha-Delaney Effect Size (VD) and the Common Language Effect Size (CLES) were used to determine the effect sizes for the Welch t-tests and ANCOVA, respectively. Significant changes were set at p <= 0.05 and VD <= 42% or VD >= 58%, or if p <= 0.05 and CLES >= 58 %. Results: Both PE groups showed significant improvements in all the measured fitness parameters except body composition. Moreover, the measured parameters of the control group reduced after eight weeks. Conclusions: The study shows evidence that PE courses can serve male universities in improving their health-related fitness. Moreover, students who do not participate in a PE course may be at risk of losing their fitness.|| Purpose: This study aimed to determine if Judo and Taekwondo in a physical education (PE) setting could improve the fitness of university students. Material: Students who registered voluntarily for the courses were considered for the study (n=27, 18-22 years for Judo; n=39, 18-22 years for Taekwondo). The control group (n=32, 20-24 years) was composed of students who were not part of a physical education course. None of the participants were college athletes nor PE students. The duration of the courses was eight weeks, twice a week with 50 minutes per session. Both courses included training for muscular fitness, flexibility, explosive strength, and cardiovascular fitness. The courses also included sparring matches and sport-specific training. The following health-related fitness parameters were measured before and after eight weeks: cardiovascular fitness using the Cooper Test, muscular endurance using 60 seconds curl-up test, trunk flexibility using the sit-and-reach test, and explosive leg strength using the standing long jump test. Parametric tests were applied to detect any effect of the courses on the students. Differences with p = 0.05 and Vargha-Delaney Common language effect size (VD) = 42% or = 58% were considered as evidence for any improvements in the fitness parameters. Results: Most of the tested parameters, apart from body composition, improved in both martial arts groups while those of the control group dropped. These changes were significantly different (p = 0.05 and VD = 42% or = 58%). The regular curl-ups and sitting stretch done during the eight weeks improved the muscular endurance and trunk flexibility of the Judo group, respectively. Moreover, continuous practice of the rolling/falling technique may have contributed to the improvement in flexibility of the Judo students. Conclusions: There is evidence that eight weeks of Judo and Taekwondo in a PE context improves the health-related fitness of male university students.|| The purpose of this study was to find out the influence of aqua aerobic and floor aerobic on selected motor fitness variables among young University players. The selected subjects (N=60) were randomly divided into three groups equally of which experimental Group - I underwent aqua aerobic, group - II underwent floor aerobics and group - III acted as Control Group. The participants selected for this study were in the age group of 18-24 years. The subjects divided into three groups. Each group consisting of twenty each, namely, experimental group I, experimental group II and control group III. The following motor fitness variables selected as dependent variables cardiovascular endurance, muscular Strength and muscular endurance and the following variables selected as independent variables aqua aerobics and floor aerobics. The data collected on selected criterion variables subjected to statistical analyses using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to find out the significant difference between the groups on the selected variables. This is conclude that the Aqua and Floor aerobic exercises, significantly improved the selected fitness variables i.e. cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength and muscular endurance of the participants.Minerals, Saudi Arabia.|| Introduction: Plyometric training is one of the most effective methods for improving explosive power. A wide variety of athletes can benefit from power training, particularly if training is followed by a strength-training program. The purpose of plyometric training is to improve the player's capacity to apply more force, more rapidly (Brad Adams, 2008). The purpose of this investigation was to find out the influence of plyometric training program on selected motor fitness components among University males. Method: A group of thirty university students was selected randomly; ages were in the range of between 18 to 24 years, Plyometric training program was employed for 12 weeks, two days in a week, 45 minutes of training per session. The subjects were segregated into two groups namely Group-A (n=20, experimental group), Group -B (n=20 control group). The plyometric training was employed on experimental group. Control group not given any special training program. The tests (pre and post) considered for this study was motor fitness components are as follows; explosive power, muscular endurance, speed and agility. To find out the mean differences from pre to post test, mean, standard deviation, and t-test computed by the help of SPSS. Results & Discussion: Twelve weeks of plyometric training protocol had revealed significant performance from pre to post-test among the participants with regard to the selected motor fitness variables with mean and standard deviation i.e. explosive power (1.74, 0.34) and (1.95, 0.36), muscular endurance (23.27, 4.68) and (28.50, 4.52), speed (5.65, 0.72) and (4.93, 0.44), agility (11.34, 2.26) and (10.35, 1.81). Conclusion: It is concluded that the influence of plyometric training had shown significant performance among the participants with regard to the selected motor fitness components i.e. explosive power, muscular endurance, speed and agility.|| In this paper, we consider a viscoelastic equation with a nonlinear frictional damping and a relaxation function satisfying g '(t) <= -xi(t)G(g(t)). Using the Galaerkin method, we establish the existence of the solution and prove an explicit and general decay rate results, using the multiplier method and some properties of the convex functions. This work generalizes and improves earlier results in the literature. In particular, those of Messaoudi (2016) and Mustafa (Math Methods Appl Sci. 2017;V41:192-204).|| In this paper, we consider the following plate problem: u(tt) - sigma Delta u(tt) + Delta(2)u - integral(+infinity)(0) k(s)Delta(2)u(t - s)ds = 0, and we show that the stability of this problem holds for a much larger class of kernels. More precisely, we consider the kernel k : [0, +infinity) -> (0, +infinity) satisfies k'(t) <= -xi(t) Psi (k(t)), t >= 0, where xi and Psi are functions satisfying some specific properties. Under this very general assumption on the behavior of kat infinity, we establish a relation between the decay rate of the solution and the growth of kat infinity. This work generalizes and improves earlier results in the literature. Moreover, we drop the boundedness assumption on the history data, usually made in the literature. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Method: Eighty males 18-25 years divided into four groups. Yogic-Walking (YW, n = 20), Yogic-Pilates (YP, n = 20), Yogic-Walking-Pilates (YWP, n = 20) and a Control Group (CG, n = 20). The experimental groups trained for 12 weeks, 3 times per week 60 min per session. Tests were assessed before and after training on physical, physiological and psychological variables. ANOVA was used for analysis. Findings: In sit & reach, sit ups and BHT, the YWP and YW showed greater mean values than the YP (P < 0.05). All groups reported similar mean values in SBP, DBP and PR (P > 0.05). In self efficacy, the YWP indicated greater mean value than the YP (P < 0.001). In self esteem, the YW had significantly more mean value than the CG (P < 0.05). Applications: YWP and YW groups showed a significant training effect in flexibility, muscular endurance and breath holding time. This apart, the combined YWP group had a greater training impact on self efficacy than the YP group.|| Introduction: Studies show that short-term aerobic exercise with diet improves glycemic control and cardiovascular health of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Such a study has not been conducted with a diet designed for Saudi residents. The purpose of the study was to find out the influence of aerobic exercise on some selected physiological parameters with intervention of diet among type 2 diabetes mellitus male adults. Method: Twenty patients (mean age (SD) = 41.2 (9.4)) during the year 2019 from the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia were distributed equally into the intervention and control groups. This was done after excluding patients with chronic diseases, or those who could not come to the study location. The intervention group went through 50-minute exercise sessions (40-90% intensity), three times a week for 12 weeks, and were provided diet recommendations. Control group was not given any specific training. Body mass, body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol, HbA1c, fasting blood glucose and resting heart rate were measured before and after the program. Significant levels were set at 0.05. Result and Discussion: Analysis of results after training programs revealed that experimental group had improved in the following variables, as follows; Body mass index of experimental group from pre to post-test with mean and standard deviation were (from 30.68 +/- 4.35 to29.63 +/- 4.58, values, P<0.02), respectively. Total cholesterol changes (from 210.1 +/- 29.46 to 167.21 +/- 21.19, values, P<0.00), HbA1c changes (from 8.91 +/- 1.28 to 8.08 +/- 1.37, values, P<0.00), Fasting blood glucose changes (from 230.4 +/- 90.37 to 210.4 +/- 81.45, values, P<0.00), Resting heart rate improved (from 82.50 +/- 4.97 to 73.90 +/- 4.62, values, P<0.00). Moreover, control group had not shown any changes from pre to post test and all the selected variables were not significant. Conclusion: It is concluded that the aerobic training with diet intervention had shown improved performance among type 2 diabetes mellitus male adults with regard to the selected variables, such as; total cholesterol, HbA1c, fasting blood glucose and resting heart rate.|| In this paper, we investigate the stability of the solutions of a viscoelastic plate equation with a logarithmic nonlinearity. We assume that the relaxation function g satisfies the minimal condition g'(t) <= -xi(t)G(g(t)), where xi and G satisfy some properties. With this very general assumption on the behavior of g, we establish explicit and general energy decay results from which we can recover the exponential and polynomial rates when G(s) = s(p) and p covers the full admissible range [1, 2). Our new results substantially improve and generalize several earlier related results in the literature such as Gorka (Acta Phys. Pol. 40:59-66, 2009), Hiramatsu et al. (J. Cosmol. Astropart. Phys. 2010(06):008, 2010), Han and Wang (Acta Appl. Math. 110(1):195-207, 2010), Messaoudi and Al-Khulaifi (Appl. Math. Lett. 66:16-22, 2017), Mustafa (Math. Methods Appl. Sci. 41(1):192-204, 2018), and Al-Gharabli et al. (Commun. Pure Appl. Anal. 18(1):159-180, 2019).|| Introduction: Right intensity of resistance training schedule is very important for improving health and performance among overweight males. Overweight condition is a big threat around the world and leads to many health hazards. Maintaining one's bodyweight ideal the following three things are important i.e. diet, exercise and lifestyle. The purpose of this investigation is to find out the influence of resistance training with low to high intensity protocol on selected health related fitness variables and muscular hypertrophy among overweight males from pre to post test. Method: A group of (N=100) participants were selected randomly to participate in this study. The age of the overweight males was in the range of 18-24 years, resistance training program was applied for 12 weeks, 45 minutes of training per session and two days in a week. These participants were segregated into two groups namely Group-A (N=50, experimental group), Group - B (N=50 control group). The resistance training was employed on experimental group. Control group was not given any above mentioned special training program. The pre and post-test considered for the selected health related fitness variables and test as follows; body composition (BMI), muscular strength (bench press 1RM), muscular endurance (sit-ups test for 30 sec), flexibility (sit & reach test) and cardiovascular endurance (12 minutes run / walk test). And test for muscular hypertrophy i.e. (participants' girth of neck, shoulders, chest, arms, waist, hips, thigh and calf). To compare the mean differences from pre to post test, mean, standard deviation, and t-test was computed by the help of SPSS-16 software and the percentages were calculated with the help of calculator online. Result and Discussion: Twelve weeks of resistance training protocol had shown significant performance from pre to post-test among the overweight males with regard to the selected health related fitness components and presented by percentages i.e. BMI (0.453%), bench press (40.33%), sit-up test (15.93%), sit & reach test (31.08%), and 12 min run/walk test (28.21%). Furthermore the muscular hypertrophy is enhance among the male participants i.e. neck (0.97%), shoulder (5.04%), chest (5.34%), arms (11.57%), thigh (9.01%), calve (3.12%); and lastly waist (-1.95%), and hip (1.76%) had shown reduction in circumference respectively from pre to post test. Conclusion: It is concluded that the impact of resistance training with low to high training protocol had shown significant performance among the overweight males with regard to the health related fitness variable i.e. (BMI), bench press, sit-up test, sit & reach test and 12 min run & walk test. As per the percentages it is concluded that the muscular hypertrophy of the overweight males i.e. neck, shoulder, chest, arms, thighs, and calves circumference had shown increased in the muscular size. Lastly the participants had shown reduction in waistline and hip circumference from pre to post test.|| Wellness is described as positive health of an individual as indicated by the quality of life and a sense of well-being. This research aimed to assess the effect of supervised fartlek training on Perceived Wellness of University Students of Saudi Arabia. A sample of forty students enrolled in various courses of KFUPM was selected for the study; the mean age was 18.52 +/- 0.599 years. Two groups were formed randomized into intervention (n=20) employed 16 weeks of supervised whistled fartlek training program and control group (n = 20) carried out their daily task and did not participate in any exercise program. The training session was conducted twice a week, and the duration of each session lasted for 45 min. All students were administered the Perceived Wellness Survey to assess their wellness. Subjects involved in regular physical activity for last 6 months were included for the study: obese students (BMI >= 30 kg/m(2)) and who are on serious illness and medication, suffered cardio-vascular problems were excluded. At baseline demographic data for all the participants were collected, including age, height, weight, how often engaged in physical activity. The statistical tool employed was an analysis of covariance to find out if any significant difference between groups after 16 weeks of supervised training. Wellness factors exhibited higher mean scores on the post-intervention group. Significant differences were observed after 16 weeks of fartlek training on psychological, emotional, physical, and spiritual wellness. Wellness composite scores improved significantly in the intervention group. Fartlek training program effectively improved the total wellness of undergraduate students.|| In this work, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for an integer of the form z(n) - y(n)/z - y to be divisible by some perfect mth power p(m), where p is an odd prime and m is a positive integer. A constructive method of this type of integers is explained with details and examples. Links between the main result and known ideas such as Fermat's last theorem, Goormaghtigh conjecture and Mersenne numbers are discussed. Other related ideas, examples and applications are provided.|| The aim of the study was to determine the effects of 12 weeks aerobic training with a diet regimen on glycemic control and cardiovascular health of boys with T1DM. The participants (N = 20) were distributed equally into an intervention group (IG) and control group (CG). The IG received 50-minute exercise sessions, thrice a week, with a diet regimen. The CG received their usual care. Body mass, body mass index (BMI), resting heart rate, blood pressure, blood lipids, fasting blood glucose, and HbA1c were measured at baseline and post-intervention. The Shapiro-Wilk test was performed before analyzing the data with parametric or non-parametric tests. Differences of p <= 0.05 and effect size (ES) >= 0.2 were considered significant. There were no differences in HbA1c between the IG and CG at baseline (10.3% (0.9) vs 10.3% (1.2), respectively, p = 0.9353). Mean HbA1c of the IG was lower than that of the CG after the intervention (9.6% vs. 11.4%; p = 0.012, 95% CI = 0.5 to 3.1, ES = 1.36). Resting heart rate, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and fasting blood glucose were better in the IG than the CG after 12 weeks (p < 0.05, ES >= 0.2). Thus, there is evidence that aerobic training with a diet regimen improves the glycemic control and cardiovascular health of boys with T1DM in 12 weeks.|| This work is concerned with a viscoelastic equation with a nonlinear frictional damping and a relaxation function satisfying g '(t) <= -xi(t)g(p)(t), t >= 0, 1 <= p < 3/2. We establish general decay rate results using the multiplier method and some properties of non-homogeneous ordinary differential inequalities. These results extend and improve many results in the literature.|| In this paper, we consider plate equations with viscoelastic damping localized on a part of the boundary and nonlinear damping in the domain. We establish general and optimal decay rate results for a wider class of relaxation functions. These results are obtained without imposing any restrictive growth assumption on the frictional damping term. Our results are more general than the earlier results.|| For every real matrix A having as an eigenvector e, the all-ones vector, an upper bound is obtained for the absolute value of its eigenvalues except, in some cases, the one associated with e. Comparisons are made between this bound and some existing bounds for stochastic matrices as well as other types of matrices such as Laplacian matrices and Randic matrices. Other examples and results are also provided. An interesting recent article 'An eigenvalue localization theorem for stochastic matrices and its application to Randic matrices', Linear Algebra Appl. 2016;505:85-96, by A. Banerjee and R. Mehatari, is useful for this present paper.|| The purpose of present study was to examine correlation between Training Load (TL), Monotony (MT), Strain (ST), Acute Chronic Work Load Ratio (ACWR), Sleep, Well-being and Incidence of Injuries over a pre competitive season. The present study further compares Training load, Monotony, Strain and ACWR over seven weeks of training in a swimming team. Twelve males from the university swimming team took part in the study with the mean age of 20.41 years, mean weight 71.16 kg and mean BMI 22.19. All participants who enrolled in the study were followed and monitored for a period of seven weeks which included both training and competition. The training load was measured by Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) x time. ACWR, strain and monotony were calculated using standard formulas. Sleep quality was measured using Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index and well-being was assessed using WHO -5 well-being Index. Pearson correlation coefficients was used to examine the relationships. There were some interesting findings as very few injuries (n=3) occur during the training and no injury taking place during the competition. Interestingly, no relationship was seen between various training parameters and sleep. While strong positive relationship was seen between TL and ST (r = 0.89), TL and ACWR (r = 0.80) and ST and ACWR (r = 0.78). The relationship was also found between ACWR a","|| Equivalence classes of e-matrices and associated eigenvalue localization regions|| Effects of combined training protocol on Coronary Heart Diseases (CHD) variables among morbid obese males|| Stability result of a viscoelastic plate equation with past history and a logarithmic nonlinearity|| Effect of Two Strength Training Models on Muscle Power and Strength in Elite Women's Football Players|| Learning Outcomes of Resistance Training on Motor Fitness Performance among Young Students|| Cumulative Sum Chart Modeled under the Presence of Outliers|| Well-posedness and asymptotic stability results for a viscoelastic plate equation with a logarithmic nonlinearity|| ANOREXIC: IMPACT OF COMPLEMENT PROTEIN ALONG WITH ADDITIONAL FOOD CONSUMPTION AND EXERCISE ON ECTOMORPHISM AND ENERGY VARIABLE AMONGST MALES|| The effect of three sport games in physical education on the health-related fitness of male university students|| Can eight weeks of judo and taekwondo physical education improve the health-related fitness of male university students?|| Influence of Aqua Aerobic and Floor Aerobic on Selected Motor Fitness Variables among Young University Players|| Influence of Plyometric Training Program on Selected Motor Fitness Components Among University Males|| Asymptotic Stability for a Viscoelastic Equation with Nonlinear Damping and Very General Type of Relaxation Functions|| General stability result for a viscoelastic plate equation with past history and general kernel|| Impact of yoga-walking-pilates, yoga-walking and yoga-pilates training regimens on physical, physiological and psychological elements among males|| Influence of aerobic exercise on some selected physiological parameters with intervention of diet among type 2 diabetes mellitus male adults|| New general decay results for a viscoelastic plate equation with a logarithmic nonlinearity|| Resistance Training with Low to High Intensity Protocol on Muscular Hypertrophy, and Selected Health Related Fitness Variables among Overweight Males|| ASSESSING THE EFFECT OF FARTLEK TRAINING ON PERCEIVED WELLNESS OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS OF SAUDI ARABIA: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL|| ON THE PRIME DECOMPOSITION OF INTEGERS OF THE FORM z(n) - y(n)/z - y|| Effects of 12 Weeks Aerobic Exercise with a Diet Regimen on the Glycemic Control and Cardiovascular Health of Boys with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus|| New general decay results in an infinite memory viscoelastic problem with nonlinear damping|| Optimal decay result for Kirchhoff plate equations with nonlinear damping and very general type of relaxation functions|| On bounding the eigenvalues of matrices with constant row-sums|| The Relationship of Training Parameters with Incidence of Injury, Sleep and Well Being of Young University Swimmers|| The Effect of Resistance Training on the Selected Physical and Physiological Variables of the Male Students|| Backache: Association with Stature, Posture and Work-Station Ergonomics in Information Technology Professionals-An Analytical Study|| Health Related Quality of Life among Saudi Undergraduate Students with Different Categories of Body Mass Index|| Fatigue: Impact of Muscular Co-Ordination among Rifle Shooters|| EXISTENCE AND A GENERAL DECAY RESULTS FOR A VISCOELASTIC PLATE EQUATION WITH A LOGARITHMIC NONLINEARITY|| On the long-time behavior of a nonlinear damped porous thermoelastic system with second sound|| Existence and a general decay result for a plate equation with nonlinear damping and a logarithmic source term|| Weight Training Protocol: Impact of Diverse and Organized Exercise on Certain Components of Motor Fitness and Functional Variables Amongst Males|| A general decay result of a viscoelastic equation with infinite history and nonlinear damping",|| Eigenvalue;

19,Architectural Engineering Department,Environmental Design,31,66,4,2,3,44.44,22.22,33.33,67.74,0,32.26,21,0,10,"|| Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify the key drivers for adopting electronic bidding (e-bidding) systems in public construction projects located in Saudi Arabia. Design/methodology/approach Literature review was undertaken to identify the drivers of e-bidding practices. Nine drivers, classified under four categories, were identified. A questionnaire survey was developed to assess the significance of the identified drivers. Responses were obtained from 20 large contractors, classified as Grade I and II contractors in Saudi Arabia, and 12 governmental authorities, representing owners of construction projects. The drivers were ranked according to their respective significance index (SI) values. Finally, a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was employed to ascertain the extent to which the two parties agreed on the significance level of the drivers. Findings Analysis of the identified drivers revealed that the most significant driver was ""reduction in the physical storage requirements of bidding paperwork."" Further, a consensus was observed with regards to the significance of the drivers. The findings of the present study highlight the strong potential of widespread e-bidding adoption in Saudi Arabia. It demonstrates the key drivers for the implementation of e-bidding through the perspective of professionals within the context of Saudi Arabia. Originality/value Prior to this study, no previous research has endeavored to assess the drivers of e-bidding adoption in Saudi Arabia. The adoption of e-bidding will benefit organizations through improved efficiencies, which could potentially lower construction costs, thereby contributing to economic growth and benefitting the society at large.|| Adaptive reuse of buildings is the practice of converting the use of an originally designed built-environment to suit a new use. This conversion process has a direct bearing on the performance of the building, and the satisfaction of the users with the conditions of the converted built-environment. This paper presents the findings of a post occupancy evaluation (POE) of an adaptively reused student housing facility to an office building, as a case study. The POE was conducted to investigate the consequences of the conversion process on the technical and functional elements of performance of the adapted building. A review of literature was performed to identify the technical and functional elements of performance pertaining to the new use of the building, along with their recommended performance criteria in codes and standards. The study employed multiple data collection methods, including a walkthrough tour to develop insights about the performance of the building elements; interviews to confirm the validity of the identified technical and functional performance elements, and initiate discussion with the users based on the findings of the walkthrough tour; and a user satisfaction survey to obtain the users' feedback on the performance of the building. The findings of the study resulted in developing a series of recommendations to improve the performance of the case study building. The paper serves to guide design professionals involved in the planning and design of adaptive reuse projects, and facilities managers in charge of the daily operations of adaptively reused buildings.|| This study aims to identify and assess the major barriers to post-occupancy evaluation (POE) implementation in the Saudi Arabian building industry. A literature review was conducted to identify 27 barriers to POE implementation in the building industry. A questionnaire survey was completed by a targeted sample of 150 building industry professionals, including 30 representatives of each influential discipline, namely architectural/engineers (A/Es), construction engineers (CEs), real estate developers (REDs), facilities managers (FMs) and owners. The findings indicated a low level of awareness of POE among these professionals, especially owners. The five most significant barriers according to the five parties were 'lack of /inadequate resources for the POE (financial, time and man-power)', 'POE is not an integrated element of the standard facility delivery process', 'lack of knowledge on POE procedures and processes', 'there is no legal provision for POE in the building industry', and 'management's preference to increase income at the expense of conducting POE'. This research represents the first study to conduct a thorough survey of the key barriers to POE implementation in Saudi Arabia. The findings highlighted the significance of the economic barriers in the implementation of POE practices. The study also demonstrated the lack of awareness about the practice of POE among the owners of building projects. Finally, recommendations for overcoming the barriers to POE implementation in the building industry were provided.|| Post-occupancy evaluation (POE) is a performance assessment methodology, which can be applied to determine the level of user satisfaction with any given facility. Since university shopping malls could have an impact on the students' academic experience and well-being, it is of paramount significance that university shopping mall facilities are designed and operated to the highest standards. The Extensive literature review highlighted the lack of POE studies for assessing the quality of shopping mall facilities. This study aims at addressing this gap, by presenting the findings of an investigative POE of a university shopping mall facility. The Literature review was conducted pertaining to the technical and functional performance requirements of shopping malls. Twenty-nine performance indicators were identified for shopping mall facilities. These were grouped under five categories, namely building performance, safety and security, proximity and accessibility, space planning and layout, and mall services. A questionnaire survey was developed based on the identified performance indicators. The survey was administered to obtain the students' feedback on the university shopping mall facility. In addition, a walkthrough tour of the mall facility was performed to identify issues, which can be immediately recognized. Finally, a plan of action was developed to improve the performance of the shopping mall facility. The study is beneficial to planners, architects and facilities managers of such facilities.|| This paper presents the development of design guidelines to improve the functional efficiency of academic and research laboratory facilities. The study was carried out in four stages, firstly, key performance indicators for the functional performance of laboratory facilities were identified. Furthermore, the space syntax theory was used to identify the functional performance issues of selected case studies, and a post occupancy evaluation (POE) was also carried out to obtain users? feedback on these case studies. Finally, design guidelines containing functional elements were assessed through a five-point Likert scale questionnaire survey, and analysed using the Relative Importance Index (RII). Sample drawings based on the guidelines were developed and reviewed by 10 professional architects. The study resulted in 31 design guidelines, grouped into 5 categories, including ?space?, ?access/circulation?, ?building features?, ?design for disabled users?, and ?design for flexibility?. The RII values showed that the top three most important design guidelines included ?ease of identifying emergency or escape route? (97.78%), ?additional space for knee and chair space under the benches? (93.33%), ?adequate teaching equipment, such as a bookstand and marker board?s storage space for student microscopes, book bags and coats? (93.33%), and ?designated office space? (89.09%). Though design guidelines exist for laboratory facilities. The current study approaches the subject matter through a triangulation of methodologies. It also re-emphasizes the need for research and development to support the evolving requirements of modern laboratory facilities. It has the specific contribution of complementing existing standards and guidelines in the design of laboratory facilities.|| Buildings in hot humid climates are energy intensive to operate. Energy consumption in Saudi Arabia is almost three times higher than the global average, and one of the major contributors to that is the residential sector. Increasing environmental and economic concerns, in the form of Saudi Vision 2030, mean that the existing unsustainable residential building stock has to be energy retrofitted. This study examines the techno-economic feasibility of retrofitting existing homes in Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. A Building Information Modelling (BIM)-based retrofit framework has been adopted and investigated on two case studies. Eight Energy Efficiency Measures (EEMs) have been implemented including increasing cooling set point temperature, using energy efficient appliances, replacing conventional lights with more efficient lights, applying window shading, improving glazing type, improving air tightness, using more efficient air conditioning system, and adding envelope insulation. A three-level energy retrofit plan is proposed. Results indicate that annual energy consumption in a villa is reduced by 13.79%, 19.27% and 56.9%, and in the apartment building by 22.84%, 28.85% and 58.5% through a level 1, 2 and 3 retrofit respectively. Compound Payback Period (CPP) was computed to assess the economic viability. For the villa, investing in a level 1, 2 and 3 retrofit will pay back in 0.92, 8.37 and 25.15 years respectively, while for the apartment building, the payback period is 0.60, 11.28 and 24.60 years respectively. Thus, energy retrofitting of existing homes has the potential to significantly reduce energy consumption, however, it is economically not viable in the existing scenario. Electricity tariffs need to be further increased and coupled with incentive programs to render deep energy retrofits feasible. Furthermore, the investigated BIM-based approach can be adopted to investigate energy retrofitting in other climate zones of Saudi Arabia and other countries in the region, and eventually be adopted to efficiently effectuate the colossal task of retrofitting the whole existing residential building stocks of these countries.

For greenhouse farming, it is preferable to use geothermal heat pump systems for energy conservation because of the stable temperature of the ground. In the same manner, heat pumps using underground air is recommended for greenhouse farming since underground air can easily be obtained from porous volcanic rocks in Jeju-do. However, direct usage of the underground air is not feasible for planting in the greenhouse or livestock care because the underground air is relatively humid and its temperature is low. For the present study, the heating performance of an air-to-water heat pump which used underground air as a heat source for greenhouse farming during the winter was assessed through measurements. In addition, the economic impact of the air-to-water heat pump (AWHP) was compared with a conventional air heater. According to the results, an AWHP can save more than 70% of the total heating costs compared with a conventional air heater. In sum, the utilization of the air-to-water heat pump using underground air can have a positive impact on reducing energy consumption as well as provide direct economic benefits.|| Purpose The purpose of this paper is to holistically identify and assess the factors affecting the workplace relocation process during its various phases, namely: pre-relocation, relocation and post-relocation. The factors assessment evaluates the perspectives and level of agreement between facilities and real estate management professionals. Design/methodology/approach Literature review was conducted to identify the factors affecting the workplace relocation process. In total, 34 factors were identified, which formed the basis of a questionnaire survey to assess their importance. Responses to the questionnaire survey were obtained through face-to-face interviews with two groups of professionals in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, 32 facilities managers (FM) and 32 real estate managers (REM). The questionnaire utilized a 5-point Likert scale of importance. Findings The research delivers rankings of the identified factors for prioritization. Where a moderate (to high) level of agreement between FM and REM professionals was remarked. Significant factors include: ""availability of workplace health and safety plan"", ""analysis of business needs for relocation"", ""cost control and management of the relocation process"", ""availability of maintenance plans"" and ""selection of fit-out contractor"". Originality/value The study provides a significant contribution to research and professional practice, while no comprehensive studies have been conducted on the various phases of the relocation process. The findings of this study are genuine to keep professionals and practitioners on the ball managing their workplace relocations, overcoming their unforeseen struggles, resourcefully and efficiently.|| Purpose The literature revealed a limited number of studies on critical success factors (CSFs) in Saudi Arabia. These studies were either outdated, covered limited factors or focused on very specific issues of a project. In response to this knowledge gap, the purpose of this paper is to identify and assess the factors which affect the success of construction projects in Saudi Arabia. Design/methodology/approach In all, 91 CSFs were identified from the literature, and grouped under eight categories according to categorization schemes adopted by earlier studies and common characteristics shared by the factors. A questionnaire survey was adopted since it permits the collection of large volumes of data in a short period. In total, 61 responses from industry experts were used to compute the significance index for each factor and rank the most CSFs. Findings Contractors viewed the three most significant CSFs as ""competency and capability of the contractors' key personnel in different disciplines,"" ""adequacy of labor resources and their skills"" and ""the impact of the project on the public."" Consultants viewed the three most significant CSFs as ""competency and capability of the consultants' key personnel in different disciplines,"" ""clear communication channels between the owner/PM and the designer"" and ""PM competency, authority and involvement."" Originality/value Although a significant number of studies have investigated CSFs for construction projects, these studies do not provide an extensive list of CSFs, and none have studied CSFs in large-scale construction projects in Saudi Arabia from the viewpoint of two key stakeholders. This study attempts to address this knowledge gap.|| The per capita energy usage in Saudi Arabia is almost three times higher than the global average. A major contributor is the residential sector which consumes almost 50% of the total national energy consumption every year. Environmental and economic pressures along with the Saudi Vision 2030 reform program advocate for an improvement in energy consumption patterns. For a sustainable residential sector, energy-efficient solutions should be adopted in the design process preferably based on building performance simulation (BPS). This study investigates the existing status and future prospects of BPS in the construction industry of Saudi Arabia. A survey has been carried out with building industry professionals to investigate the existing practices in terms of use of BPS. Energy and environmental savings achievable through application of BPS have been estimated by modelling a typical residential villa as a case study. The results indicate that presently BPS is not being adequately applied by the building industry and a number of barriers exist which need to be addressed. The case study simulation indicates that electricity consumption of a villa based on a BPS-based design process is 51.3% less than the existing typical residential villa.|| Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify and assess the significance of various factors affecting maintenance costs of public school facilities. Design/methodology/approach Detailed literature review resulted in identifying 54 factors that were categorized under nine groups. This was followed by a questionnaire survey completed by 60 experienced professionals. The relative importance index was used to determine the in-group ranking, as well as the overall ranking of these factors. Findings The study established that the five most significant factors affecting the maintenance cost of public school facilities were ""not providing operations and maintenance manuals to maintenance group"" in the ""construction phase"" category, ""ignoring maintainability studies in design"" in the ""design phase"" category, ""specification of low-quality materials"" in the ""design phase"" category, ""selection criteria of contractors"" in the ""regulations and contracting"" category, and ""lack of quality control during work execution"" in the ""construction phase"" category. Originality/value The present research represents the first research covering the maintenance cost of public school facilities in Saudi Arabia. The study also presents the unique landscape of facility maintenance in the Saudi Arabian context. The outcome of this research has the potential to significantly cut down unnecessary costs rooted in expensive maintenance of public school facilities, enhancing the quality of these facilities. The findings also underscore the necessity of collaboration and coordination of the various key disciplines toward the realization of cost-effective school facilities.|| Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the current practices of the early facilities management (FM) involvement during the design development and review stages (DDRS), and recommend activities aimed at achieving better integration. Design/methodology/approach A comprehensive literature review was conducted to ascertain the challenges faced by the integrated design team (IDT) in the absence of the facilities managers' review of design solutions, and underscore the significance of the early involvement of facilities managers during the DDRS. A questionnaire survey was then developed for collecting data on eight aspects of the current practices of early FM involvement during the DDRS. The questionnaire survey was administered to the FM departments of 13 long established, public universities in Saudi Arabia. Ten responses were obtained and analyzed. Findings The findings suggest that the early involvement of the FM department enhances the operation and maintenance of facilities. This has been measured through reductions in the number of architectural, structural, electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilating and air conditioning defects. Practical implications - Recommendations were provided to facilitate the process of integrating the practices of two influential stakeholders of building projects. These recommendations encompass the need for maintainability considerations at the early schematic stage, the necessity of direct contact between the two parties and the necessity of facility managers' increased familiarity of the design stage activities, among other recommendations. In this way, the study promotes the awareness of the significance of integrating FM with the IDT at the DDRS. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature and practice by presenting a detailed analysis of the integration process between the FM department and the IDT. Furthermore, the outcomes of the integration between the parties were measured to assess the effectiveness of the collaboration and highlight the possible areas of improvement.|| Properly prepared design documents are crucial to the success of construction projects. Poor design documents can have a range of adverse effects on various construction project stakeholders. This research explored the significance of various consequences of Design Documents' Deficiencies (DDDs) on large construction projects. A comprehensive literature review, and questionnaire survey were conducted. Overall, 15 consequences were identified. Based on responses from 41 designers and 30 contractors, a significance index was assigned to each of the identified consequences of DDDs. The most significant consequences of DDDs were 'design changes' and 'frequent change orders', respectively. The test of agreement revealed a moderate-high level of agreement between designers and contractors. The findings were used to recommend an action plan for preventing the occurrence of DDDs. It is envisioned that this research will increase the awareness of the consequences of DDDs, and hence, contribute to their reduction. The study contributes to the literature by identifying various consequences of DDDs from diverse sources and synthesizing them into a single study. The study also provides separate and combined viewpoints of two key stakeholders of construction projects on the impact DDDs can have on themselves, and the project as a whole. The study contributes to the literature by identifying the various consequences of DDDs in a fast-growing economy in which minor design errors can translate to substantial financial losses. Further, the identified consequences can be employed as performance measures for assessing an organizations' progress towards continuous improvement of their design practice.|| In light of the spread of residential fires worldwide, this paper aims to identify the current fire safety code requirements for providing the minimum level of safety in residential facilities, hence, mitigating the risk of fire occurrence. The paper also presents the findings of a case study to demonstrate the compliance level of a sample residential facility, with code requirements. The case study building is composed of three floors and a basement. It can accommodate 214 persons. It was built in 2013, and it is located in Khobar, Saudi Arabia. The study revealed that the assessed facility had an adequate distribution of fire detection and notification systems. Moreover, the level of the housekeeping practices and concentration of hazardous material was found to be acceptable. However, the means of egress, fire doors and fire suppression systems were not up to code requirements. The study recommended measures to improve the level of safety in the building. These include increasing the number of fire exits; installing sprinkler heads on each floor; distributing fire extinguishers sufficiently; and installing fire rated doors. This study aims at raising awareness about the incidences of fires accidents in residential facilities and their catastrophic implications. It serves to provide a standardized fire safety management checklist, for the use of design professionals and property managers, towards the effective design and maintenance of residential facilities.|| Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop and assess interdisciplinary design checklists for mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) systems' coordination, for building projects, in Saudi Arabia. Design/methodology/approach Relevant documents were acquired including: heating, ventilation and air conditioning schedules; ductwork and chilled water pipes layout; and technical queries, among others, from residential and school projects. Next, factors influencing MEP systems' coordination were extracted, and verified to ensure clarity and validity. They were formulated into design checklist items for MEP systems. Finally, the checklist items were assessed through a questionnaire based on a five-point Likert scale of importance. Respondents were comprised of mechanical, architectural, construction, electrical engineers, design coordinators and quality assurance managers. Data were then analyzed using the relative importance index. Findings This study presents 63 design checklist items. The items for each discipline were grouped under four categories, highlighting specific considerations. The findings revealed that careful consideration and communication between the mechanical, structural and architectural design teams was paramount in achieving proper mechanical coordination. Furthermore, it was found that constant communication between the electrical and the other design teams was necessary, to avoid electrical design conflicts. Finally, fire safety consideration was found to be most important in plumbing systems' coordination. Originality/value The checklists for facilitating the MEP coordination process in building projects aim at minimizing waste in resources and enhancing the overall quality and productivity. In the absence of existing checklists, this paper provides a practical benefit to design professionals to alert them to devote more effort to the dominant category of checklist items.|| One of the critical decisions taken by contractors is whether or not to bid for a project. This is due to the complexity and uncertainty surrounding this decision, which is influenced by many factors. Given the above challenge, this study aimed to uncover the critical factors affecting the contractors' bidding decisions in Saudi Arabia-based construction projects. A questionnaire survey, which consisted of 31 factors, was distributed to first-, second- and third-grade contractors. In total, 67 responses were obtained. Median and relative importance index (RII) techniques were adopted for ranking the most critical factors. Based on the received responses, the top six critical factors were ""size of the job"", ""type of the job"", ""company's strength in the industry"", ""designer/design quality"", ""rate of return"", and ""project cash flow"". The least significant factors were ""job start time"" and ""labor environment (union/nonunion/cooperative)"". The findings of this study show a level of agreement among all contractors about the critical factors. The findings would benefit contractors and subcontractors by increasing their understanding of the major factors affecting the bidding decision process. Contractors armed with such valuable information will be better able to enhance their bidding decision-making process in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.|| Many construction projects exceed time and budget. The Saudi Arabian construction projects are not an exception to this phenomenon. However, the causes of time and cost overrun of Saudi Arabian oil and gas construction projects have never been studied. Thus, this paper endeavors to investigate the main causes of time and cost overrun in Saudi Arabian oil and gas construction projects. Thirty-eight causes of time and cost overrun were identified through the literature and an interview. Responses from 48 professionals based in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia were obtained. The respondents were solicited to evaluate the significance of the causes, which were then ranked and a test of agreement was conducted. All survey participants agreed that the five major causes of time and cost overrun, combined, were found to be ""changing of design and scope by client during construction"", ""poor planning and scheduling of project"", ""design errors"", ""Inadequate comprehension of scope of work at the bidding stage"", and ""underestimating of cost and schedules/overestimating of benefits"". On the other hand, the major cause of time overrun was found to be ""changing of design and scope by client during construction"". Finally, the major cause of cost overrun was found to be ""underestimating of cost and schedules/overestimating of benefits"", respectively. The findings of this study will be beneficial to project stakeholders who must operate in an industry that is highly sensitive. The findings will also facilitate organizations planning to conduct construction projects in the Saudi Arabian oil and gas industry.|| The diffraction of a spherical sound wave by a thin hard half-plane is considered. The total field at any position in the space surrounding the edge of the half-plane is composed of three components, two of which are expressed from pure geometrical considerations, and a third component which seems to originate from fictive sound sources situated on the edge of the half plane. This paper takes the expression of the edge-diffracted field as formulated in the Biot-Tolstoy theory of diffraction for the case of a doublet sound signal emanating from the sound source [Biot and Tolstoy (1957). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 29, 381-391] but rearranged later in a more tractable form by Medwin [(1981). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 69, 1060-1064] for the more general case of a Dirac-like pulse. Hence a development in the frequency domain of the Fourier transform of the exact expression of the edge-diffracted field in the time domain takes into consideration a part with known special mathematical functions, and a part containing a serial development. This latter also expressed in some special mathematical functions, converges quite rapidly to the numerical Fourier transform of the exact time-domain expression. The presented solution may be used as a good approximation in simulations and in real case predictions of sound attenuation by thin hard barriers.

Among 16 community buildings, four buildings were selected and the parameters that had an impact on energy consumption were identified through the analysis of electricity and gas consumption. After the validation with the measured data of electricity and gas, the energy simulation was used to model the newly constructed community building. A combined passive and active design strategy was applied to improve the energy performance. To offset the energy use for the domestic hot water, possible renewable energy systems such as the PV system, the solar thermal system, and the geothermal heat pump system were reviewed and their efficiency was analyzed. As a result, the combination of the PV system with additional PV modules and the geothermal system was chosen for the achievement of the nearly zero energy target.|| Construction is a high-risk industry due to the high rates of accidents/fatalities recorded annually in various countries. Health and safety (HS) is a major concern of the construction industry. More so, for developing countries where HS cultures are yet to become fully established. In such situations, the perception of construction workers is a viable approach to assess the performance of HS. This study investigated the HS conditions in Saudi Arabian construction sites from the perspective of construction labor. The study employed a questionnaire comprised of 50 issues related to safety and health from an employee's perspective, on a 1-5 Liked scale of agreement. Responses were obtained from 196 construction workers in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Results from the study showed that the crucial issues identified include: lack of communication between front-line supervisors and construction labor, less priority for safety compared to productivity; lack of employee-engagement in developing safety policies; poor morale and lack of motivation amongst workers; and un-tested emergency response procedures. Thus, the study suggests that addressing such issues will allow for improved safety performance in the Saudi Arabian construction industry.|| The study aims to investigate the potential for rooftop application of solar PV in the residential sector of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) taking into account the two main types of buildings i.e. apartments and villas. It is the first detailed study in KSA which focuses on the utilizability of building rooftops considering various structural, services and cultural parameters. The work employs remote sensing and GIS techniques to gather the building rooftop data for a district in the city of Al-Khubar covering 33,000 residential units. The data was validated through site visits of sampled buildings and regression models were created to examine the relationships between PV areas and the roof areas in the study area. PVSOL software was then used to model the application of PV on building rooftops and to determine the impact of shading.

Therefore, this subject was comprehensively investigated by applying a recent crystallization model, non-isothermal DSC experiments, Raman spectroscopy, and WAXRD. The multi-layer GnP-induced nucleation and the crystal growth rates were modelled. The overall modelling effort generated new insights, results, and explanations. This study confirmed and elucidated, or refuted several published conclusions. It has also been reported that the present model can pursue differences in catalyst-mediated i-PP backbone defects (stereo and regio) by simulating the relative crystallization profile and determining the crystallization kinetic triplet (n, k( o), and E- a). The multiple roles played by GnP were underscored, which exceed what the related literature currently reports. The Raman and XRD work revealed the interaction between GnP and i-PP. The shear-induced dispersion of GnP that occurs during extrusion significantly affected i-PP crystal size distribution. The present approach can also assess the effects of catalyst type and structure, and backbone defect types and their distribution on the non-isothermal crystallization of, in general, polyolefin blends and nanocomposites.|| NiO-beta-Bi2O3-Bi2SiO5/SBA-15 catalysts, containing 10-20 wt% Ni and 10-30 wt% Bi loaded as metal weight on mesoporous SiO2 support (SBA-15), were utilized for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane to butadiene, comparing from the viewpoint of Bi oxide phase and combination balance with Ni oxide and the support. Bi2SiO5 and beta-Bi2O3 phases change depending on Ni/Bi ratio. ""Reverse core-shell"" structure with uniform mesoporosity catalytically active for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane to butadiene was successfully synthesized with semi-dry conversion method. The shell was formed as Bi2SiO5/SBA-15 by partially dissolving an array of silanol inside SBA-15 mesopores with impregnated bismuth nitrate. The Bi2SiO5 of the shell was increased by co-impregnated nickel nitrate. The layered core faced to mesopore was formed as catalytically active NiO/beta-Bi2O3 on the shell. The degrees of formation Bi2SiO5 and beta-Bi2O3 reflected in the butadiene selectivity through changing the reducibility and dispersion properties. The catalyst with moderate loading of 20 wt% Ni and 10 wt% Bi exhibited a high advantage in the n-butane conversion: 30 % and butadiene selectivity: 49 % at 450 degrees C compared to the less and excess loaded catalysts. The catalytic performance of other mesoporous silica support catalysts also changed differently depending on Bi2SiO5 and beta-Bi2O3 phases.|| Infrared spectra of dealuminated high silica MFI zeolites were measured to elucidate the structure of silanol groups active for conversion of 1-butene to propene. The OH groups were replaced by OD groups to have clear vibrational spectra. Two sharp bands and one broad band were observed; isolated silanol at 2746 cm(-1), terminal silanol at 2725 cm(-1), and hydrogen-bonded silanols centered at 2570 cm(-1) composed of more than one components. Based on the response of these bands to Na poisoning and pyridine adsorption together with the correlation with catalytic results, we propose that the active sites for propene formation are one of the terminal silanol groups and one of the hydrogen-bonded silanol groups in a silanol nest. The active hydrogen-bonded silanol groups are the one whose O atom is hydrogen-bonded to adjacent two H atoms in the silanol nest. Graphic|| Palladium nanoparticles (similar to 1-3 nm, 0.4 wt% Pd) were uniformly distributed over the surface of fibrous silica nanospheres (KCC-1) modified via aminopropyltriethoxysilane using a fast and cost-effective palladium (II) chloride reduction process. The Pd nanoparticles (Pd NPs) distribution over the ensuing catalyst Pd/KCC-1-NH2 showed much more uniform distribution, and smaller size compared with the tedious hydrothermal reduction method. The morphological, chemical, and size analyses of Pd/KCC-1-NH2 by BET, UV-Vis spectra, XRD, HR-TEM, EDS and XPS analysis revealed that the succeeding material consist of a distinct fibrous silica nanospheres support adorn with Pd NPs. The resultant nanocatalyst was tested for the one-step reductive aminoformylation of aromatic nitro compounds using formic acid. A wide range of substituted nitroarenes including electron withdrawing, releasing, sterically hindered and multifunctional groups have been converted to corresponding aryl formamide in quantitative yields (yields up to 98%) at moderate temperature (70 degrees C). Optimization study has proved that the 6 equivalent of formic acid is required and toluene was found to be the better solvent. The established practice is beneficial due to the use of formic acid as H-2 source and formylating agent, easiness in handling of the catalyst and simple workup procedure with efficient catalyst reusability. [GRAPHICS] .|| Crude oil and refinery products are transported worldwide to meet human energy needs. During transportation via pipeline, huge pumping power is required to overcome the frictional pressure drop and the associated drag along the pipeline. The reduction of both is of great interest to industry and academia. Highly expensive ultrahigh molecular weight (UHMW, MW >= a million Dalton) drag reducing polymers (DRPs) are currently used to address this problem. The present paper, therefore, emphasizes particularly the development of a high-performance catalyst system that synthesizes DRPs (using higher alpha-olefins)-a highly promising cost reduction alternative. This homogeneous catalyst system features a new concept that uses a cost-effective titanium-based Ziegler-Natta precatalyst and a cocatalyst center dot Lewis base complex having both steric hindrance (around N heteroatom) and electronic effect. This novel work, which involves precatalyst-cocatalyst molecular separation and cocatalyst center dot monophenyl amine association-dissociation phenomena, already generated several US patents. The subject catalyst prepares UHMW DRPs at room temperature, avoiding the use of zero and sub-zero temperatures. The resulting product almost tripled the rate of transportation of a selected grade of refinery product and saved about 50% pumping energy at ppm level pipeline concentration. It is also very easily soluble. Hence, massive modification of existing pipeline will be unnecessary. This will save additional infrastructure cost. This paper also summarizes challenges facing the development of improved heterogeneous catalysts, dispersed polymerization process, molecular simulation-based DRP product formulation, and model/theory of turbulent mixing and dispersion in the transportation pipeline setting.|| The kinetics of the hydrolysis of heavy hydrocarbons in supercritical water were probed using density function theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the probe molecule dibenzyl ether (DBE). The focus of the study was the effect of solvent on the reaction kinetics. The DFT studies were aimed at the estimation of the kinetic parameters and the transition-state structure, whereas the MD studies were aimed at the estimation of the solubility parameters used in a model of the reaction nonidealities. Both DFT results, with an imposed dielectric constant to represent the solvent polarity, and the MD results, where the solubility parameter was estimated, indicated that the fastest kinetics were attained at the highest polarity. The COSMO-sigma profiles obtained from DFT calculations revealed that the transition state for the reaction was more polar than the reactants. The MD simulation provided estimates of the solubility parameters of reactants and the transition state, which allowed a complementary estimate of the rate of the reaction in a supercritical water solution via transition-state theory. The rates of reaction estimated from DFT and MD calculations at 674 K were in fair agreement with experimental data at low values of the dielectric constant.|| Solubility parameters of supercritical water and methanol were probed by using molecular dynamics simulation. The computed solubility parameters agree well with the theoretical values for different temperatures and pressures within the supercritical region. The results show that the solubility parameter decreases with increasing temperature and increases with increasing the pressure. The polarity of the system increases at higher temperatures; therefore, the degree of molecular aggregation increases. Raising the pressure of the system reduces the degree of aggregation between molecules and increases the solubility parameter of the system.|| Molybdenum and vanadium oxide catalysts with varied compositions (Mo/V = 1/1, 7/3, 8/2, and 9/1) were prepared using a modified citrate-nitrate auto-combustion method for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. These catalysts were characterized by BET-technique, TPR, XRD, SEM, Raman, and UV spectroscopy. The effects of washing and supercritical CO2 drying on catalysts during the preparation steps were investigated. Results show an interaction between the molybdenum and vanadium metal ions in all of these catalysts due to the presence of a peak at 785 cm(-1) from the Raman study, which was assigned to a polymolybdovanadate species V-O-Mo vibration. This interaction could be efficient for alkane activation reaction. The catalysts were evaluated in a fixed bed micro-reactor at temperatures in the range of 350-600 degrees C and at atmospheric pressure. The activity of the catalyst increased by increasing the molybdenum content. All of the catalysts in this study showed 100 % selectivity for propylene in the temperature range of 350-450 degrees C; however, the propylene selectivity was found to decrease with an increase in the temperature. The highest yield of 4.8 % with 100 % propylene selectivity was obtained for a catalyst with Mo/V ratio of 9:1 at 500 degrees C.|| Alternative methods for determining the critical micelle concentration (CMC) are proposed using coarse grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In the literature, the CMC value is commonly taken to be the ""free"" (unassociated) surfactant concentration in the presence of micellar aggregates given by MD simulations. In the present study, two surfactants with different head groups and the same alkyl tail, n-octyltrimethylammonium bromide (C8TAB) and sodium octyl sulfate (S8S), were used to calculate the CMC value. The CMC of surfactants can be calculated from the variation in the zero-shear-rate viscosity as a function of the surfactant concentration in both the premicellar and micellar regions. Linear slopes were obtained in both regions with increasing surfactant concentrations. The CMC values for C8TAB and S8S were determined from the intersection of the two lines and are in good agreement with experimental values.|| Ni-Bi-O/structured mesoporous (MCM-41, SBA-15, and silica foam) silica catalyst with 20 wt% Ni and 30 wt% Bi has been studied in oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane to butadiene. Mesoporous SBA-15 showed a clear superiority in activity and selectivity as compared to MCM-41, silica foam and conventional silica. The order of the butadiene yield was SBA-15 > Silica foam > MCM-41 > conventional silica. SBA-15 catalyst exhibits the best performance (butadiene selectivity: 47.5% at n-butane conversion: 28.9%) due to the presence of Bi2O3-a phase (a = 0.2-0.4) as well as the strong base with weak/moderate acid sites, as evident from XRD and TPD analysis, respectively. The formation of Bi2O3-a (a = 0.2-0.4) phase is related to the template effect of structurally ordered silica.|| The catalytic activity of ZSM-5 zeolites with a SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio of 30, 50, 80, 280, and 410 was investigated in a fixed bed continuous flow reactor system and was found that the ZSM-5 zeolite with SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio of 280 (HZ-280) exhibited best catalyst performance. The optimized reaction conditions achieved were 500 degrees C, 1 bar pressure, and weight hourly space velocity of 15 h(-1) using methanol as feed. At optimum reaction conditions, HZ-280 exhibited propylene selectivity of 47.3% and propylene yield 17.4% with 100% methanol conversion. HZ-280 zeolite was modified with P, Ce, Fe, and La to select the best promoter to enhance propylene selectivity and yield. The best-modified catalyst obtained was HZ-280 with 0.1 wt % phosphorus loading, which further improved propylene selectivity by 14% and yield by 24.7%. Then, the monolith structured catalysts were prepared by single-layer (6.8%), double-layer (10.3%), and triple-layer (13.1%) coating of HZ-280 catalyst. HZ-280 single-layer-coated monolith-structured catalyst effectively increased propylene selectivity by 19.2% and yield by 34.5% with no liquid hydrocarbons in the product. HZ-280-coated monolith catalyst was regenerated and was reused for three cycles. Negligible activity loss was observed for methanol conversion and propylene selectivity. This reflects that the structured catalyst is viable and economical for commercial applications. Analytical techniques such as X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, and NH3-temperature-programmed desorption were used for characterization of the catalysts.|| During recent years, the catalytic transformation of CO2 using silicon-hydrides as reductants has emerged as a promising methodology that allows the selective reduction of CO2 to the formate, formaldehyde, methoxide or methane level under mild reaction conditions. Moreover, some catalysts have been employed for the formylation and/or methylation of the N-H bonds of secondary and/or primary amines by their reaction with CO2 and hydrosilanes. This work summarizes the different catalytic systems that have shown to be efficient for the above-mentioned reactions. Furthermore, a brief description of the reactions performance and the conditions employed in each case is included.|| A molecular-level kinetic model was constructed for the hydroisomerization/hydrocracking of a hydrotreated deasphalted oil feed. A kinetic network was developed for the lube base oil production containing 1105 molecular species and 15 991 reactions grouped into nine reaction families. The molecular composition of the feedstock was reconstructed by minimizing the difference between experimental data and simulated mixture properties. More specifically, hydrocarbon types, carbon number distribution, and sulfur level were matched very accurately. To model the kinetics and reduce the computational load, the Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson rate law parameters were constrained using the linear free-energy relationship principles. Using the experimental process and product data of hydroisomerization over a commercial catalyst, the reaction kinetics were optimized on the basis of 141 data points. Excellent agreement was found between experimental and simulated properties of the lube base product of hydroprocessing at three different temperatures.|| The demand for improved gasoline product quality has helped make molecular-level models become more preferred for the modern refinery. Building the molecular compositional model is an essential first step for this quantitative molecular management of gasoline streams. Gas chromatography equipped with flame ion detection (GC-FID) is commonly used in the gasoline detailed hydrocarbon analysis (DHA). The combination of GC-FID analysis and molecular-level modeling is thus very attractive. In the present study, we developed a gasoline compositional model based solely on GC-FID as input. To suppress the negative influence of peak coelution, we developed a statistics-based peak tuning algorithm to obtain individual compound resolution at higher carbon number range. Using the tuned result as input, the molecular-level gasoline compositional model was built by estimating the quantitative percentages of the species in a predefined molecular library (573 molecules). The molecular-level compositional model has good extensibility and can link to the molecule-based physical properties prediction model. The model has been verified via applications on various gasoline samples. The prediction of research octane number for large-scale gasoline samples was also revealed.|| The thermal and catalytic cracking of Arabian Light crude oil, which has a density of 34 degrees API, were evaluated in a fixed-bed microactivity test (MAT) unit between 550 and 650 degrees C. For the catalytic cracking, two catalysts were used, a steamed commercial MFI catalyst (M-cat) and an equilibrium FCC catalyst (E-cat). Thermal and catalytic cracking were compared at the same conversion, 34%, at 650 degrees C. For both, as the temperature increased, the yields of light olefins, LPG, dry gas, and coke increased, associated with a consistent decrease in heavy ends (LCO and HCO). The naphtha yield for catalytic cracking decreased as temperature increased; however, for thermal cracking, it was nearly constant. The superiority of catalytic cracking over thermal cracking for the propylene yield was interpreted in terms of mechanisms of free radicals and carbenium ions. Thermal cracking gave a higher yield of ethylene. At high temperature (650 degrees C) and catalyst to oil (C/O) ratio of 4, the olefins yield decreased in the order of M-cat (32.7 wt %) > E-cat (30.3 wt %) > thermal cracking (22.8 wt %). The highest yields of ethylene and propylene (10.9 and 15.7 wt %), achieved over M-cat at 650 degrees C, are attributed to shape selectivity and higher acidity. The naphtha yield for E-cat was much higher than for M-cat; for instance, at 550 degrees C it was 48.3 wt % for E-cat and 24.4 wt % for M-cat. This was attributed to diffusion limitations for M-cat. The effect of the C/O ratio on conversion and yields was also inspected, and the analysis showed that after a C/O ratio of 4, further increases had only a minor effect. Lastly, the effect of mixing E-cat and M-cat at different percentages was evaluated, and the investigation showed an optimum point at 58% M-cat, with the corresponding yields of ethylene and propylene at 10.7 and 19.2 wt %, respectively.|| The dehydrogenation of formic acid permits the production of hydrogen virtually free of carbon monoxide, which is a key requisite for its use in fuel cells. Moreover, HCOOH is a suitable hydrogen carrier, better in several crucial characteristics than other liquid organic hydrogen carriers, namely, low toxicity, high hydrogen content and recyclability (via CO2 hydrogenation). The most successfully employed catalysts are those based on Ir, Ru, Rh, and Fe metal centers. The catalytic cycles through which homogeneous metal complexes operate show a wide mechanistic diversity. The nature of catalytic cycle depends mainly on the nuclearity of the active species, the type of CO2 formation step (-hydride elimination, hydride abstraction, or outer-sphere mechanism), and whether the rate-limiting step relates to CO2 or H-2 formation. Different outer-sphere interactions have been proposed in the literature in order to explain the success of homogeneous catalyst, which seems to be common ground for most of the catalysts so far reported.|| n-butane oxidative dehydrogenation was studied over Bi-Ni/TiC, Bi-Ni/SiC, Bi-Ni/Silicalite-1, and unsupported Bi-Ni catalyst. The co-impregnation technique was followed, with fixed 0.30 and 0.20 g/g for Bi and Ni respectively. The physico-chemical properties were measured by means of BET, XRD, CO2/NH3-TPD, and H-2-TPR techniques. The catalytic test results revealed that bimetallic Bi-Ni/TiC catalyst exhibited the highest n-butane conversion of 16.6% with dehydrogenation selectivity of 83.7% (1,3-butadiene and butenes selectivity of 50.7 % and 33% respectively). As regards Bi-Ni/TiC catalyst, the main operating parameters including O-2/n-C4H10 feed ratio, space velocity, and reaction temperature were varied. The Bi-Ni/TiC catalyst showed adequate stability for a 10 h time on stream test. The high performance of Bi-Ni-O/TiC catalyst is attributed to the synergistic role of reducibility, presence of strong basic sites and weak acidic sites, and an increased metal species dispersion over the TiC support. A kinetic study of n-butane oxidative dehydrogenation was carried out. The apparent activation energy for formation of butadiene was estimated to be the lowest (15 kJ/mol), while the highest activation energy (105 kJ/mol) is required for the undesirable cracking reaction.|| The wet incipient impregnation technique was used for the synthesis of nonpromoted and lanthanide series-promoted (La, Ce, Eu, Pr, and Gd) Ni/gamma-Al2O3 catalysts. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were determined using X-ray diffraction, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray, and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) characterization techniques. Activity and the resistance to coke formation of nonpromoted and lanthanide series-promoted 12%Ni/gamma-Al2O3 catalysts were investigated for diesel steam reforming in a fixed-bed reaction system. BET analysis showed no remarkable difference in the surface area of 12%Ni/gamma-Al2O3 and 5%Pr-12%Ni/gamma-Al2O3 (Pr-Ni) catalyst as compared to other promoted 12%Ni/gamma-Al2O3 catalysts. Pr-Ni catalyst also has the higher BET surface area among other synthesized lanthanide-promoted 12%Ni/gamma-Al2O3 catalysts. TEM analysis indicated uniform metal dispersion of promoted catalysts. Moreover, TPR analysis indicated an optimum interaction between the metal and the support in the Pr-Ni catalyst. Therefore, experimental results presented the maximum diesel conversion, H2 selectivity, H-2 yield, and reforming efficiency over Pr-Ni catalyst as compared to all other studied catalysts during a 40 h run at 620 degrees C, 1 atm, steam to carbon ratio = 3.0, gas hourly space velocity of 5800 h1, and 6 ppm sulfur contents in the fuel. Furthermore, thermogravimetric analysis and CHNS analysis also confirmed the low amount of coke formation over the surface of the 5%Pr-12%Ni/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst.|| An amorphous porous hexagonal aluminosilicate Al-ZAT was prepared using liquid crystal phase of Brij-56 and preformed MFI zeolite nanoclusters solution through bottom-up approach. The HCl concentration (0.5-2.0 M), HCl to Brij-56 ratio and zeolitic seed solution wss varied for the mesoporous system at ambient synthesis condition. The optimum Brij-56 to HCl ratio was found to be 1 Brij 56: 9-19 HCl (0.5 M) by mass. The addition of preformed zeolite seed (7-14 ml) as precursor solution instead of conventional silica source tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS) generate uniform mesophase and subsequently avoids formation of methanol (from TMOS hydrolysis) that affects liquid crystalline mesophase. MCM-41 (ZMCM-41) and SBA-15 (ZSBA-15) derived from similar zeolite precursor solution was synthesized for comparative study. The porous textural characteristics, and type of surface acidity were studied. The analysis showed a highly porous hexagonal structure of Al-ZAT. ZMCM-41 prepared through top-down approach, showed formation of ordered nanostructured mesoporous (disordered hexagonal). Al-ZAT and ZSBA-15 shows weaker Bronsted acid sites compared to ZMCM-41.|| The catalytic cracking of light paraffinic crude oil with an API gravity of 51 degrees was compared using two laboratory testing techniques, a fixed-bed microactivity test (MAT) unit and a fixed fluidized-bed advanced cracking evaluation (ACE) unit. Both units were operated using equilibrated FCC catalyst (E-Cat), MFI zeolite (ZSM-5), and E-Cat/MFI (equal mixture with MFI) at two temperatures (550 and 600 degrees C) and a constant catalyst-to-oil ratio of 4.0. Despite the different hydrodynamics in MAT and ACE reactors, both units gave similar catalyst ranking based on the conversion of 221+ degrees C feed fraction at 550 and 600 degrees C in the order of E-Cat > E-Cat/MFI > MFI, which is attributed to diffusion limitation of MFI catalyst. While both testing techniques showed variation in product yield structure (dry gas, LPG, naphtha, and unconverted 221+ degrees C) over the three catalysts, the ACE unit gave significantly higher coke yield compared with MAT. The highest yield of light olefins was obtained over E-Cat/MFI (29 wt %) at 600 degrees C in MAT compared with MFI (23 wt %) and E-Cat (21 wt %). The effect of high temperature (650 degrees C) on crude oil cracking in ACE showed an increase in conversion and light olefins yield for all catalysts as well as in thermal cracking case (no catalyst) associated with a decrease in naphtha yield. The highest yields of light olefins (35 wt %) was obtained at a naphtha yield of 37 wt % over E-Cat/MFI compared with 30 and 41 wt %, respectively, for no catalyst. However, the operation at high temperature introduced the adverse effects of thermal cracking resulting in high yields of dry gas (14 wt % for E-Cat and 17 wt % for no-catalyst), which reflects a significant contribution of pyrolytic cracking reactions.|| The Delplot technique for the classification of experimentally derived reaction products as primary, secondary, tertiary, etc. was extended to address experiments in which reaction products are present in non-zero concentrations in the feed. This allows use of the Delplot method for the complex feedstocks common in energy applications, such as crude oil, where lumped models containing boiling-point-defined pseudocomponents will frequently have non-zero product amounts in the experimental feedstocks. We found that the existence of the intermediate products in the feed changes the behavior of the Delplots. For example, in the A ->(k1) B ->(k3) C; A ->(k2) D sequence with B-0 not equal 0, the Delplot can suggest B to be primary, secondary, or neither depending upon the ratios k(1)/k(2) and A(0)/B-0. These findings suggest key additional experiments covering different limits to be able to identify the proper classification of the intermediate products in the reaction network.|| A molecular-level kinetic model for the hydroprocessing of methyl laurate was constructed. The reaction network was deduced using experimental observations in the context of the delplot method for the discernment of product rank. The resulting 45 species and 83 reactions were used to construct the set of material balances in the kinetic model. Kinetic parameters of the model were determined by minimizing the difference between model outputs and experimental data for methyl laurate hydroprocessing. Differences in reactivity as a result of catalyst metal composition were modeled via the catalyst family concept. The model results show good agreement with the experimental results for a range of process conditions.|| This work describes the results from the studies on the potential of [Ir(-Cl)(cod)](2) (cod=1,5-cyclooctadiene) as metallic precursor for the preparation of Ir(NSiN) complexes (NSiN=fac-bis-(pyridine-2-yloxy)methylsilyl). The reaction of [Ir(-Cl)(cod)](2) with bis-(pyridine-2-yloxy)methylsilane enabled the synthesis of [Ir(H)(Cl)(NSiN)((2)-cod)] with an uncommon (2)-coordination mode for the cod ligand. The application of Ir-NSiN species as catalysts precursors for the dehydrogenative silylation of carboxylic acids was also explored. The outcomes from these catalytic studies revealed a clear influence of the ancillary ligand on the catalytic activity of Ir-NSiN species. Thus, whereas [Ir(H)(CF3SO3)(NSiN)(coe)] shows poor catalytic activity, the related complex [Ir(H)(CF3CO2)(NSiN)(coe)] with a trifluoroacetate ligand was demonstrated to be a highly active catalyst precursor.|| The computer-aided reconstruction of gasoline composition is an active area of petroleum and petrochemical research as a result of the demand for molecular-level management of the petroleum feed streams. To that end, in this work, a molecular compositional model based on a predefined representative molecular set was built that allows for the conversion of conventional bulk property data to an approximate molecular composition. The selection of representative molecules was based on their presence in gasoline molecular compositional measurement and their potential contribution to the key physical properties. Around 170 hydrocarbons and heteroatom species were chosen as predefined identities of molecules that can exist in a gasoline sample. The physical property data of all of the representative molecules were collected, and suitable mixing rules for the gasoline range stream were applied for the accurate prediction of bulk properties. The approximate concentration of representative molecules was obtained through fitting the predicted bulk property to the measured data. The methodology was verified through intensive tests on various gasoline samples, including straight-run naphtha, catalytic cracking gasoline, coking gasoline, and reformates. The modeling was also accomplished in a sequential order using basic to advanced measurements to find the optimum number of measurements required for detailed composition evaluation on various feedstocks. The propagation of error in the experimental measurement and prediction method on composition has been evaluated.","|| Non-isothermal crystallization of Ziegler Natta i-PP-graphene nanocomposite: DSC and new model prediction|| Oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane to butadiene catalyzed by new mesoporous mixed oxides NiO-(beta-Bi2O3)-Bi2SiO5/SBA-15 system|| Infrared Study of Silanol Groups on Dealuminated High Silica MFI Zeolite to Correlate Different Types of Silanol Groups with Activity for Conversion of 1-Butene to Propene|| Effective and selective direct aminoformylation of nitroarenes utilizing palladium nanoparticles assisted by fibrous-structured silica nanospheres|| Energy-Saving UHMW Polymeric Flow Aids: Catalyst and Polymerization Process Development|| Solvent Effects for the Hydrolysis Reaction of Dibenzyl ether in Supercritical Water: A Combined Density Functional Theory and Molecular Dynamics Simulation Study|| A Molecular Dynamics Simulation Probe of the Solubility Parameters of Supercritical Water and Methanol|| Synthesis, characterization, and evaluation of high selectivity mixed molybdenum and vanadium oxide catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane|| Determining Critical Micelle Concentrations of Surfactants Based on Viscosity Calculations from Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics Simulations|| Pore structure effect of support in Ni-Bi-O/mesoporous silica catalyst on oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane to butadiene|| Selective Production of Propylene from Methanol over Monolith-Supported Modified-ZSM-5 Catalysts|| Homogeneous Catalytic Reduction of CO2 with Silicon-Hydrides, State of the Art|| Molecular-Level Kinetic Modeling of Lube Base Oil Hydroisomerization|| Computer-Aided Gasoline Compositional Model Development Based on GC-FID Analysis|| Conversion of Arabian Light Crude Oil to Light Olefins via Catalytic and Thermal Cracking|| Mechanistic Considerations on Homogeneously Catalyzed Formic Acid Dehydrogenation|| BIMETALLIC BI-NI OXIDES OVER CARBIDE SUPPORTS FOR OXIDATIVE DEHYDROGENATION OF N-BUTANE: EXPERIMENTAL AND KINETIC MODELLING|| Hydrogen Production through Steam Reforming of Diesel over Highly Efficient Promoted Ni/gamma-Al2O3 Catalysts Containing Lanthanide Series (La, Ce, Eu, Pr, and Gd) Promoters|| Synthesis of hexagonal aluminosilicate from liquid-crystalline mesophase using zeolitic nanoclusters: bottom-up versus top-down approach|| Catalytic Cracking of Light Crude Oil to Light Olefins and Naphtha over E-Cat and MFI: Microactivity Test versus Advanced Cracking Evaluation and the Effect of High Reaction Temperature|| Extension of the Delplot Analysis for Experiments with Non-zero Initial Product Concentrations|| Molecular-Level Kinetic Modeling of Methyl Laurate: The Intrinsic Kinetics of Triglyceride Hydroprocessing|| Reactivity of Ir-NSiN Complexes: Ir-Catalyzed Dehydrogenative Silylation of Carboxylic Acids|| Molecular Representation of the Petroleum Gasoline Fraction","|| DSC; i-PP-GnP nanocomposite; non-isothermal crystallization kinetics; Raman; WAXRD|| n-Butane; Dehydrogenation; Butadiene; SBA-15; Bi2SiO5|| Silanol groups; IR spectroscopy; MFI zeolite; 1-Butene; Propene|| Fibrous silica, KCC-1; Palladium nanoparticles; Aminoformylation; Nitroarenes|| drag reducing polymer; crude oil; refinery product; Ziegler-Natta precatalyst; 1-hexene-dodecone copolymerization; dispersed polymerization process; product formulation; molecular simulation; turbulent mixing and dispersion|| nan|| Supercritical fluid; Solubility parameter; Molecular dynamics simulation; Methanol; Water|| vanadium; molybdenum; citrate-nitrate auto-combustion; propylene; oxidative dehydrogenation of propane|| nan|| Oxidative dehydrogenation; n-butane; Butadiene; MCM-41; SBA-15; Silica foam|| nan|| Carbon dioxide; formylation; amines; methylation; hydrosilylation; homogeneous catalysis|| nan|| nan|| nan|| Hydrogen; Reaction mechanisms; Homogeneous catalysis; Dehydrogenation|| oxidative dehydrogenation; butadiene; n-butane; bimetallic oxides; support|| nan|| Brij-56; Zeolitic seed; Nanoclusters; Mesoporous; Top-down; Bottom-up approach|| nan|| nan|| nan|| carboxylic acids; dehydrogenation; iridium; ligand effects; silanes|| nan"

However, very few studies have been carried out in the region of Saudi Arabia, especially related to high-yielding oleic acid strains. The current study is focussed on the isolation of indigenous microalgae strains that were analyzed for N/P removal and biofuel production. Three strains were isolated, and identified as Chlorella kessleri (S1), Chlorella vulgaris (S2) and Nanochloropsis oculata (S3). The S2 strain showed the highest dry weight as compared to S1 and S3. All of the isolated strains showed greater than 90% nitrate and phosphate removal. Lipid contents of 19, 27 and 14% were found in S1, S2 and S3, respectively. Fatty acid profiles using Gas Chromatography Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID) showed 18, 22 and 16% yield of palmitic and 6, 4 and 5% yield of stearic acid in S1, S2 and S3, respectively.|| Gene editing that makes target gene modification in the genome by deletion or addition has revolutionized the era of biomedicine. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 emerged as a substantial tool due to its simplicity in use, less cost and extraordinary efficiency than the conventional gene-editing tools, including zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs). However, potential off-target activities are crucial shortcomings in the CRISPR system. Numerous types of approaches have been developed to reduce off-target effects. Here, we review several latest approaches to reduce the off-target effects, including biased or unbiased off-target detection, cytosine or adenine base editors, prime editing, dCas9, Cas9 paired nickase, ribonucleoprotein (RNP) delivery and truncated gRNAs. This review article provides extensive information to cautiously interpret off-target effects to assist the basic and clinical applications in biomedicine.|| In the anaerobic process, fat-oil-grease (FOG) is hydrolysed to long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) and glycerol (GLYC), which are then used as substrates to produce biogas. The increase in FOG and LCFAs inhibits methanogenesis, and so far, most work investigating this inhibition has been carried out when FOG or LCFAs were used as co-substrates. In the current work, the inhibition of methanogenesis by FOG, LCFAs and GLYC was investigated when used as sole substrates. To gain more insight on the dynamics of this process, the change of microbial community was analysed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The results indicate that, as the concentrations of cooking olive oil (CO, which represents FOG) and LCFAs increase, methanogenesis is inhibited. For instance, at 0.01 g. L-1 of FOG, the rate of biogas formation was around 8 ml.L-1.day(-1), and this decreased to < 4 ml.L-1.day(-1) at 40 g.L-1. Similar results were observed with the use of LCFAs. However, GLYC concentrations up to 100g.L-1 did not affect the rate of biogas formation. Acidic pH, temperature > = 45 degrees C and NaCl > 3% led to a significant decrease in the rate of biogas formation. Microbial community analyses were carried out from samples from 3 different bioreactors (CO, OLEI and GLYC), on day 1, 5 and 15. In each bioreactor, microbial communities were dominated by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla. The most important families were Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceae and Shewanellaceae (Proteobacteria phylum), Clostridiacea and Ruminococcaceae (Firmicutes) and Porphyromonadaceae and Bacteroidaceae (Bacteroidetes). In CO bioreactor, Proteobacteria bacteria decreased over time, while those of OLEI and GLYC bioreactors increased. A more pronounced increase in Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were observed in CO bioreactor. The methanogenic archaea Methanobacteriaceae and Methanocorpusculaceae were identified. This analysis has shown that a set of microbial population is selected as a function of the substrate.|| Numerous enzymes of biotechnological importance have been immobilized on magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) via random multipoint attachment, resulting in a heterogeneous protein population with potential reduction in activity due to restriction of substrate access to the active site. Several chemistries are now available, where the modifier can be linked to a single specific amino acid in a protein molecule away from the active-site, thus enabling free access of the substrate. However, rarely these site-selective approaches have been applied to immobilize enzymes on nanoparticles. In this review, for the first time, we illustrate how to adapt site-directed chemical modification (SDCM) methods for immobilizing enzymes on iron-based MNP. These strategies are mainly chemical but may additionally require genetic and enzymatic methods. We critically examine each method and evaluate their scope for simple, quick, efficient, mild and economical immobilization of enzymes on MNP. The improvements in the catalytic properties of few available examples of immobilized enzymes are also discussed. We conclude the review with the applications and future prospects of site-selectively modified magnetic enzymes and potential benefits of this technology in improving enzymes, including cold-adapted homologues, modular enzymes, and CO2-sequestering, as well as non-iron based nanomaterials.|| The potential of six ancient Tuscan sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.) varieties as a source of health-promoting pentacyclic triterpenes is here evaluated by means of a targeted gene expression and metabolite analysis. By using a sequence homology criterion, we identify five oxidosqualene cyclase genes (OSCs) and three cytochrome P450s (CYP85s) that are putatively involved in the triterpene production pathway in sweet cherries. We performed 3D structure prediction and induced-fit docking using cation intermediates and reaction products for some OSCs to predict their function. We show that the Tuscan varieties have different amounts of ursolic and oleanolic acids and that these variations are related to different gene expression profiles. This study stresses the interest of valorizing ancient fruits as alternative sources of functional molecules with nutraceutical value. It also provides information on sweet cherry triterpene biosynthetic genes, which could be the object of follow-up functional studies.|| Lactase-like multicopper oxidases (LMCOs) are versatile enzymes used as biocatalysts performing the oxidation of different substrates of industrial relevance, with or without the intervention of a mediator. They have attracted a lot of interest for biotechnological applications in light of their ecofriendliness: they indeed oxidize the substrate(s) by coupling the four electron reduction of the final acceptor, molecular oxygen (O-2), to water. Plant LMCOs represent a still poorly studied, important class of oxidoreductases controlling e.g. the post-harvest quality of fruits and enabling the tailoring of designer energy crops. We here sought to identify the LMCOs in Prunus avium L., whose fruits are rich in bioactive molecules, but are also highly perishable. The goal was to analyze them using bioinformatics (phylogenetic and in silico structural analyses) and to perform a targeted expression study on a subset of genes in six ancient varieties from Tuscany, all threatened by genetic erosion. These sweet cherry varieties contain higher amount of bioactive molecules, as compared to commercial counterparts. The results shown demonstrate strikingly different gene expression patterns in the six ancient varieties ('Benedetta', 'Carlotta', 'Crognola', 'Maggiola', 'Morellona', 'Moscatellal belonging to the Tuscan Regional Bank of Germplasm, as compared to a widely used commercial one ('Durone'). The motivation of this study is the economic importance of P. avium and the involvement of LMCOs in post-harvest fruit parameters, like color. The results presented pave the way to follow-up researches on LMCOs of sweet cherry exploring post-harvest fruit parameters (e.g. anthocyanin stability responsible for pericarp browning and the preservation of the appealing red color), as well as developmental processes, like stony pit formation.|| We studied the prevalence and key risk factors responsible for overweight and obesity in different age and sex groups in Malakand Division Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pakistan. Several components of lipid profile and body mass index were obtained for 562 individuals of the population using standard techniques of WHO. Preclinical data were collected based on stratified random sampling design to investigate about the lifestyle, food, blood pressure, cigarette consumption, snuff use and other diseases and life activities. The prevalence of overweight and obesity and their relationship with different gradients were investigated using multivariate analysis, i.e., cluster analysis and ordination techniques. Multivariate analysis classified the individuals into three major dichotomies (groups) and identified triglyceride, cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins and total lipids (P > 0.001) as the most influential factors associated with the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the region. The results showed the highest percentage (40%) of obese individuals followed by overweight (38%) and normal (22%), respectively, in the age ranged from 15 to 61 years. It indicated that overweight and obesity is common and an overriding phenomenon in the area. Our findings showed that obesity is significantly higher in female particularly in married women as compare to the male individuals may be due to the unawareness, lifestyle and food. The present pilot study is the first comprehensive report that will help understanding on the prevalence and general awareness about the risk factors associated with overweight and obesity ""a Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs)"" in Pakistan.|| Contamination of the environment by petroleum products is a growing concern worldwide, and strategies to remove these contaminants have been evaluated. One of these strategies is biodegradation, which consists of the use of microorganisms. Biodegradation is significantly improved by increasing the temperature of the medium, thus, the use of thermophiles, microbes that thrive in high-temperature environments, will render this process more efficient. For instance, various thermophilic enzymes have been used in industrial biotechnology because of their unique catalytic properties. Biodegradation has been extensively studied in the context of mesophilic microbes, and the mechanisms of biodegradation of aliphatic and aromatic petroleum hydrocarbons have been elucidated. However, in comparison, little work has been carried out on the biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons by thermophiles. In this paper, a detailed review of the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons (both aliphatic and aromatic) by thermophiles was carried out. This work has identified the characteristics of thermophiles, and unraveled specific catabolic pathways of petroleum products that are only found with thermophiles. Gaps that limit our understanding of the activity of these microbes have also been highlighted, and, finally, different strategies that can be used to improve the efficiency of degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons by thermophiles were proposed.|| This study aims to determine the effect of climatic factors (temperature, relative humidity and rainfall) on mosquito abundance and to map mosquito larva breeding sites using GIS application in Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. The data pertaining to larval and adult mosquito abundance/distribution and climatic factors were collected for the study period of 2014. Bi-variate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the relationship between mosquito abundance and climatic factors (temperature, relative humidity and rainfall). The utilization of GIS with GPS facilitates to identify and map larva breeding sites in the study area. The result showed strong negative correlation between mosquito abundance and temperature while there appeared a strong positive correlation with relative humidity and moderate positive correlation with rainfall. Low mosquito abundance was observed at high temperatures whereas high and moderate mosquito abundance was observed at high humidity and during rainy months, respectively. In the adult mosquito, the regression model for three climatic factors (temperature, RH and rainfall) and other factors showed a variation of 84.5% of the variance accounted for the climatic factors while the remaining 15.5% were attributed to other factors. In larva, 64.3% of the variance accounted for climatic factors, and the remaining 35.7% attributed to other factors such as the presence of vegetation, waste materials and water reservoirs such as ditches. In comparison, the larva seems influenced by the presence of vegetation, waste material, water reservoirs and ditches and less influenced by climatic factors than the adult mosquito. Development of a risk map by considering the flying distance of the adult mosquito from the studied sites showed three major clusters where a recom- mendation for management control program was suggested.

Molecular O-2 plays 2 critical roles in this biodegradation process. O-2 activates the aromatic rings through hydroxylation prior to ring opening and serves as a terminal electron acceptor (TEA). However, several microorganisms have devised ways of activating aromatic rings, leading to ring opening (and thus biodegradation) when TEAS other than O-2 are used (under anoxic conditions). These microorganisms belong to the sulfate-, nitrate-, and metal-ion-reducing bacteria and the methanogens. Although the anaerobic biodegradation of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and LWM-PAH naphthalene have been studied, little information is available about the biodegradation of HMW-PAHs. This manuscript reviews studies of the anaerobic biodegradation of HMW-PAHs and identifies gaps that limit both our understanding and the efficiency of this biodegradation process. Strategies that can be employed to overcome these limitations are also discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Publications of genomes/transcriptomes of the colonial microalgae, Gonium pectorale (Gp) and Volvox carteri (Vc), between 2010-2016 prompted us to look for cellulase genes in these algae and to compare them to cellulases from bacteria, fungi, lower/higher plants, and invertebrate metazoans. Interestingly, algal catalytic domains (CDs), belonging to the family GH9, clustered separately and showed the highest (33-42%) and lowest (17-36%) sequence identity with respect to cellulases from invertebrate metazoans and bacteria, respectively, whereas the identity with cellulases from plants was only 27-33%. Based on comparative multiple alignments and homology models, the domain arrangement and active-site architecture of algal cellulases are described in detail. It was found that all algal cellulases are modular, consisting of putative novel cysteine-rich carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) and proline/serine-(PS) rich linkers. Two genes were found to encode a protein with a putative Ig-like domain and a cellulase with an unknown domain, respectively. A feature observed in one cellulase homolog from Gp and shared by a spinach cellulase is the existence of two CDs separated by linkers and with a C-terminal CBM. Dockerin and Fn-3-like domains, typically found in bacterial cellulases, are absent in algal enzymes. The targeted gene expression analysis shows that two Gp cellulases consisting, respectively, of a single and two CDs were upregulated upon filter paper addition to the medium.|| Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are environmental pollutants from incomplete combustion and petroleum products. As the molecular weight increases, PAHs become more recalcitrant to biodegradation. A bacterial strain capable of metabolizing the four fused aromatic ring PAH pyrene was isolated and characterized. The analysis of 16S rRNA gene revealed that it belongs to Achromobacter xylosoxidans species. A. xylosoxidans PY4 can utilize pyrene as the sole source of carbon. PY4 has a doubling time (dt) of less than 1 day when it grows in the presence of 1-5 mg l(-1) pyrene, a dt range similar to that of the most efficient pyrene biodegrading bacteria described so far. The optimal pyrene degradation conditions are at pH 7-9, 37-40 degrees C, and 0-2.5% NaCl. PY4 also utilizes salicylic acid, catechol, naphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene. PY4 degrades more than 50% of 100 mgl(-1) of pyrene, within the first 15 days, at a rate of 0.069 day(-1), R-2 = 0.99. The metabolites include monohydroxypyrene, 1-methoxy1-2-H-benzo[h]chromene-2-carboxylic acid, 9,10-phenanthrenequinone, 1-methoxyl-trans-2'-carboxybenzalpyruvate, and dibutyl-phthalate. Up-expressed proteins in response to pyrene are involved in cell homeostasis, genetic information synthesis and storage, and chemical stress. Among these proteins are 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase and homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase, involved in the lower pyrene degradation pathway.|| Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (MIONPs) have been extensively utilized for several applications that include catalysis (artificial enzymes, nanozyme), renewable energy harvesting, solvents detoxification, heavy-metal remediation, biosensors and medical biotechnology such as drug delivery and magnetic resonance imaging. The magnetic susceptibility of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) is the key feature, which enables them to be utilized for these applications. Depending on specific applications, various experimental methods like hydrothermal, sol-gel, co-precipitation, physical (PVD), and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) can be employed for the fabrication of MIONPs of desired properties. This review critically discusses various techniques for the synthesis and characterization of MIONPs, and their key applications in the fields of health, environment, agriculture, energy, and industrial sectors. The review is concluded with suggestions for future research with a view to efficient utilization and technological applications of MIONPs.|| Brevibacillus borstelensis AK1 is a thermophile which grows between the temperatures of 45 degrees C and 70 degrees C. The present study is an extended genome report of B. borstelensis AK1 along with the morphological characterization. The strain is isolated from a hot spring in Saudi Arabia (southeast of the city Gazan). It is observed that the strain AK1 is rod-shaped, motile, and strictly aerobic bacterium. The whole genome sequence resulted in 29 contigs with a total length of 5,155,092 bp. In total, 3,946 protein-coding genes and 139 RNA genes were identified. Comparison with the previously submitted strains of B. borstelensis strains illustrates that strain AK1 has a small genome size but high GC content. The strain possesses putative genes for degradation of a wide range of substrates including polyethylene (plastic) and long-chain hydrocarbons. These genomic features may be useful for future environmental/biotechnological applications.|| Anoxybacillus flavithermus AK1 is a thermophilic bacterium that is able to survive at temperatures ranging from 55 to 60. The AK1 strain was isolated from the hot spring ""Al-Ain Alhara"" located at a distance of 50 km southeast of the city of Gazan, Saudi Arabia. This study presents the morphological characterization of A. flavithermus AK1, including a detailed description of its complete genome sequence. A total of 50 contigs were used to produce a genome sequence of 2,630,664 bp that includes 2724 protein-coding genes and 75 RNA genes, 18 of which are rRNA genes. A comparison of this genome sequence with those of Anoxybacillus flavithermus strains that were previously submitted to NCBI revealed that the AK1 strain has the smallest genome size with the highest GC content. The strain can therefore be exploited for several biotechnological applications based on its high thermophilic potential.|| Contamination of the environment by high-molecular-weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (HMW-PAH) occurs in hypersaline conditions, mainly in produced water derived from petroleum extraction, and biological treatment offers an attractive option to remove these pollutants. This study aimed at isolating and characterizing bacteria that biodegrade HMW-PAH pyrene in a halophilic environment. Two bacteria, 10PY2B and 20PY1A, were isolated by enrichment culture in 10% and 20% NaCl, respectively, in the presence of pyrene as the sole source of carbon. Using 16S rRNA analyses, 10PY2B was identified as Halomonas shengliensis and 20PY1A as Halomonas smyrnensis. These strains had doubling times of less than 24h when pyrene was used at concentrations <50ppm, making them as rapidly growing pyrene-biodegrading bacteria as the reference strain Mycobacterium vanbaalenii. 10PY2B and 20PY1A were more active at neutral to alkaline conditions, and at 25 degrees C, efficiently biodegraded aromatic compounds of lower molecular weight than pyrene (sodium salicylate, naphthalene, phenanthrene, and anthracene). Within 18 days, the strains had biodegraded 50% of 50ppm pyrene, and gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy led to identification of the metabolites 4-phenanthrenecarboxylic acid, 4-(1-hydroxynaphthalen-2-yl)-2-oxo-but-3-enoic acid, and phthalic acid. A possible pathway for pyrene biodegradation has been proposed based on these metabolites.","|| Isolation of indigenous microalgae: nitrogen/phosphorous removal and biofuel production|| Latest Developed Strategies to Minimize the Off-Target Effects in CRISPR-Cas-Mediated Genome Editing|| Characterisation and microbial community analysis of lipid utilising microorganisms for biogas formation|| Site-directed chemically-modified magnetic enzymes: fabrication, improvements, biotechnological applications and future prospects|| Tuscan Varieties of Sweet Cherry Are Rich Sources of Ursolic and Oleanolic Acid: Protein Modeling Coupled to Targeted Gene Expression and Metabolite Analyses|| Identification of the laccase-like multicopper oxidase gene family of sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.) and expression analysis in six ancient Tuscan varieties|| Overweight and Obesity Prevalence Pattern and Associated Risk Factors Among the People of Malakand Division, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pakistan|| Current Status of the Degradation of Aliphatic and Aromatic Petroleum Hydrocarbons by Thermophilic Microbes and Future Perspectives|| Combining GIS application and climatic factors CrossMark for mosquito control in Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|| Biodegradation of high-molecular-weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons under anaerobic conditions: Overview of studies, proposed pathways and future perspectives|| Novel Insights from Comparative In Silico Analysis of Green Microalgal Cellulases|| Pyrene biodegradation and proteomic analysis in Achromobacter xylosoxidans, PY4 strain|| Synthesis, Characterization and Applications of Magnetic Iron Oxide Nanostructures|| Insights into Brevibacillus borstelensis AK1 through Whole Genome Sequencing: A Thermophilic Bacterium Isolated from a Hot Spring in Saudi Arabia|| Novel Anoxybacillus flavithermus AK1: A Thermophile Isolated from a Hot Spring in Saudi Arabia|| Characterization of Halophilic Bacteria Capable of Efficiently Biodegrading the High-Molecular-Weight Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Pyrene",|| Renewable energy; environmental microbiology; carbon dioxide mitigation; gas chromatography; fatty acid analysis|| CRISPR; Cas9; gene targeting; targeting specificity; homology dependent repair; base editors; non-homologous end joining repair pathway|| nan|| Nanobiotechnology; Magnetic nanoparticles; Site-selective immobilization; Genetic modification; Native chemical ligation; Protein engineering; Click chemistry; Metal organic framework; Catalysis; Cold-adapted|| Prunus avium L; Tuscan varieties; pentacyclic triterpenes; oxidosqualene cyclase; cytochrome P450; gene expression; bioinformatics|| nan|| Obesity; Risk factors; Body mass index; Non-communicable diseases; Public health problem; Classification and ordination|| biodegradation; thermophiles; petroleum hydrocarbons; aliphatics; aromatics; metabolites|| Mosquito control; Climatic factors; GIS; Eastern Province; Saudi Arabia|| Polycyclic-aromatic-hydrocarbons; Biodegradation; Anaerobic; Sulfate-reducing bacteria; Nitrate-reducing bacteria; Methanogens|| cellulase; glycosyl hydrolase family 9; carbohydrate binding module (CBM); bioinformatics; RT-qPCR|| Biodegradation; Bioremediation; pyrene; Achromobacter xylosoxidans; Proteomics; Biotransformation; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons|| Energy harvesting; Nanoparticles; Nanotechnology; Environmental remediation; Health; Industry; Agriculture|| nan|| Anoxybacillus flavithermus AK1; Hot spring; Saudi Arabia; Thermophile|| bioaugmentation; biodegradation; gas chromatography; halophile; metabolites; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; pyrene

Researchers in the construction domain have investigated similar uses for UWB-based RTLSs on construction jobsites. However, most of these investigations comprised small-scale experiments using average accuracy only to demonstrate use cases for the technology. Furthermore, they did not consider alternative deployment scenarios for practically feasible deployment of the technology. To overcome these limitations, a series of experiments were performed to study the feasibility of a commercially available RTLS on the construction jobsites. The focus of the work was on feasibility in terms of accuracy analysis of the system for a large experimental site, the level of effort requirements for deployment, and the impact of deployment alternatives on the accuracy of the system. The results found that average accuracy was found to be a misleading indicator of the perceived system performance (i.e., 95th percentile values were considerably higher than average values). Moreover, accuracy is significantly affected by the deployment alternatives. Collectively, the results arising from the study could help construction/safety managers in decision making related to the deployment of UWB-based RTLSs for their construction sites.|| Physical exertion led fatigue is a serious threat to occupational health and safety of construction workers worldwide. Its acute effects include a decrease in cognitive abilities, productivity and heightened risk of accidents whereas prolonged physical exertion led fatigue could lead to psychological issues and development of musculoskeletal disorders. To monitor physical exertion, traditionally questionnaires have been used while recent advances have focused on onsite and on-body sensors to automate the process. Considering the limitation of the recent approaches, this study explored the use of combined cardiorespiratory and thermoregulatory measures to model physical exertion using machine learning algorithms. Controlled manual material handling experiments were conducted during a preliminary study to induce exertion at a steady rate involving ten participants. The results revealed that the proposed methodology could predict exertion levels with a high accuracy of 95.3% for combined data modeling of all participants. However, for some predictions, the error between predicted and actual exertion was up to five levels on the Borg-20 scale. To mitigate this issue, individualized machine learning models were used that effectively reduced the maximum error to one level with an average accuracy of 96.7% while using only one-tenth of the total data set. Overall, this study highlights the advantage of using multiple physiological measures for enhancing physical exertion modeling. Notably, the study underpins the use of individualized models for exertion monitoring and management to prevent physical fatigue development and its ill effects.|| The energy consumption of a constructed facility is a primary concern as a result of its impact on the total energy expenditure. It has been found that up to 70% of the power consumption in Saudi Arabia are caused by building structures and air conditioning (AC). Energy consumption in government-constructed buildings constitutes a considerable approximate to 13% of the consumption of the total energy in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, the government of Saudi Arabia initiated the Saudi Energy Efficiency Program (SEEP) that goals to lower the domestic energy severity by roughly 30% by 2030. This paper introduces a study carried out in Eastern Province in Saudi Arabia to identify factors influencing the consumption of energy in school facilities (which are built of concrete in hot and humid climate zones), investigate the correlation between those factors and their impacts on the consumption of energy in school facilities, and finally, develop a prediction model for the energy consumption of school facilities. The study was based on the utilization of 352 real-world datasets of energy consumption of operating schools across Eastern Province in Saudi Arabia. The developed energy prediction model considers eleven identified factors that influence the consumption of energy of constructed schools. The identified factors were utilized as input variables to build the model. A systematic search among different neural network (NN) design architectures was conducted to identify the optimal network model. Validation of the developed model on eight real-world cases demonstrated that the accuracy of the developed model was about 87.5%. Moreover, the findings of this study indicate that the weakest correlation between the input variables was recorded as -0.015 between ""type of school"" and ""AC capacity,"" while the strongest correlation was recorded as 0.95 between the variables of ""number of classrooms"" and ""total air-conditioned area (sqm),"" followed by ""total air-conditioned area (sqm)"" and ""number of students,"" which was recorded as 0.90. It is worth noting that ""AC capacity"" was the most significant predictor, which increased exponentially for high values of energy consumption, followed by ""total school roof area."" The study also found that the age of the schools had a very small impact on energy consumption, although the age of the schools varied from 11 to 51 years. This was probably due to a good maintenance system applied by the Ministry of Education. The implication of the developed prediction model was that the model can be used by the Ministry of Education to predict the energy consumption and its associated cost for public school buildings for the purpose of budget allocation. The model may be utilized as a stand-alone application, or it can be integrated with an existing building information module (BIM)-based system.|| The need for resilience and an agile waste management system in Saudi Arabia is vital to control safely the rapid growth of its municipal solid waste (MSW) with minimal environment toll. Similarly, the domestic energy production in Saudi Arabia is thriving and putting a tremendous pressure on its huge reserves of fossil oil. Waste to energy (WTE) plants provides a golden opportunity for Saudi Arabia; however, both challenges (MSW mitigation and energy production) are usually looked at in isolation. This paper at first explores the potential of expanding the WTE energy production in the eastern province in Saudi Arabia under two scenarios (complete mass burn with and without recycling). Secondly, this study analyzes the effect of 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle) practices implementation in a residential camp (11,000 population) to influence the behavior of the camp's citizens to reduce their average waste (kg/capita). The results of the 3R-WTE framework show a potential may reach 254 Megawatt (MW) of electricity by year 2030. The 3R system implementation in the camp reduced MSW production from 5,625 tons to 3000 tons of household waste every year, which is considered lower than what the surrounding communities to be produced in the same area.|| Purpose This paper aims to focus on ergonomics intervention and quality implementation at a chemical manufacturing plant in Saudi Arabia that is prone to increased number of quality defects and shutdowns. Design/methodology/approach The paper applies the quality improvement through ergonomics (QUITE) methodology as a solution to improve the level of plants quality and reliability. The QUITE implementation relies on a great amount of human participation and constant check of quality results. The study is conducted to solve two main problems in the plant under study, namely, degradation in the products quality and unsolved frequent shutdowns in the production line Findings The study findings suggested to automate the inspection process through ""User Alert"" system to stimulate the operator attention who triggers a corrective action to avoid any possible process upset of plant shutdown. The implementation increased productivity from 280 to 310 ton; quality conformance from 91.7 to 96.80 per cent; and reduced shutdown from 1.26 days to almost zero downtime. Originality/value The work shed the light on the effect of ergonomics on the quality of finished products. Usually, ergonomics is related to the work environment. However, ergonomics initiatives can spearhead improvement in production quality.|| The construction of a new facility in an urban area, such as a downtown area, involves considerable earthwork excavation most of the time. Measuring the actual productivity of earthwork operations that involve heavy machinery can be a complex task for project managers. The complexity contributes to the impact of the many factors involved, the required accuracy, and the uncertainties associated with such operations. Traditionally, measuring actual productivity is carried out manually by measuring the actual quantities of the excavated earth. Measuring actual productivity manually is time-consuming and not necessarily accurate. The paper presents a case study project in Montreal to investigate the application of a developed methodology that is affordable for small to medium size contractors. It integrates the GPS and fuzzy set theory as an alternate effective methodology for measuring actual onsite productivity during the construction stage in an urban area. The developed methodology combines GPS data that are collected in near real time, fuzzy set theory (FST), and Google Earth. FST is used to define the variability and uncertainty which exists in the duration of the main activities of the earthwork (loading, traveling, dumping, and returning). Google Earth is used for graphical presentation and to store the collected GPS data of the moving hauling units. The productivity estimated by the developed methodology was compared with that provided by a simulation-based model, in which the collected GPS data are used to define the duration of earthmoving moving operations, and with that measured manually by contractor. The developed methodology proves that the utilization of GPS data and FST can yield a more accurate estimation of onsite actual productivity compared to that provided by simulation-based approaches, but in much a simpler way regarding the computation effort and time.|| Cash flow management entails forecasting, monitoring, and controlling practices of the cash inflow and outflow and arrangement of deficits over a project's duration. This article reveals, through a questionnaire survey, the techniques and practices that construction companies in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia follow to forecast and manage cash flow at the project level. The majority of the contractors perform cash flow forecasting for setting a cash flow baseline and determining the proper financing method. They use credit financing for materials, subcontract a good portion of projects, and use company assets and credit financing to pay for equipment and labor.|| This article aims to propose a new model to assess the Saudi public contract for risk sharing through the investigation of the perceptions and proposals of owners and contractors in Saudi Arabia on the statement of the clauses of the contract. The data collection tool used is a survey questionnaire comprising 70 items that refer to each clause of the Unified Contract for Public Works (UCPW) in Saudi Arabia. A sample size of 42 was determined using Kish's formula (20 contractors and 22 owners) and a total number of 46 responses had been received. The results revealed that, in general, respondents did not believe that risk sharing exist in the Saudi UCPW. Moreover, 11 new areas of disagreement emerged from the proposals of the respondents. Using the Chi-square test, the data was tested for dependency on respondent's type, and it was found that the number of risks allocated to each party is independent from the type of respondent.|| This paper presents a study conducted to identify, assess, rank, and compare the most influencing factors causing schedule delays during the construction phase of petrochemical projects in Saudi Arabia. The methodology followed in this research to achieve the main aims is a combination of the comprehensive review of the literature and the interviewing of a number of local experts, which have resulted in identifying 23 factors. A total of 90 completed responses were gathered from 106 received responses. The study found that the most influencing factors causing schedule delays during the construction of petrochemical projects in Saudi Arabia are ""Poor site management and supervision by contractors""; ""Conflict between the main contractor and subcontractor""; ""Poor planning and scheduling of projects by the contractor""; ""Delays in material or equipment delivery""; and followed by ""Delays in Handing Over Construction Site to the Contractor"". This paper is original in the sense that the areas of knowledge and practice covered in the identified factors were distributed and not available in one source. The factors are derived from personal interviews with selected project managers, project engineers, construction supervisors, and the others from different positions in the project department and from the relevant literature.|| Recently, there has been an increase in the use of geographic information systems (GISs) for various purposes, which indicates the significance of this technology. This paper intends to examine the emergence of two technologies, particularly web and GIS, as a maintenance reporting tool. It is important that all buildings and public utilities at the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals campus, Saudi Arabia, are safe and in good working condition, as they significantly participate in the delivery of every facility's mission. Associated web developing tools such as JavaScript, MongoDB online database, jQuery, widgets and Google Maps application programming interfaces (including Geocoding, reverse Geocoding and Google Maps markers) were used to achieve the proposed solution. It was found that those tools could integrate, manage and visualise spatial data with respect to maintenance activities. Consequently, they save time for end users as well as achieve more than average daily work requests, enhance planning and scheduling, improve coordination between interrelationship departments and create a professional working environment.","|| Use of Ultra Wide Band Real-Time Location System on Construction Jobsites: Feasibility Study and Deployment Alternatives|| Physical exertion modeling for construction tasks using combined cardiorespiratory and thermoregulatory measures|| Prediction of the Energy Consumption of School Buildings|| Deploying Municipal Solid Waste Management 3R-WTE Framework in Saudi Arabia: Challenges and Future|| Quality improvement through ergonomics intervention at chemical plant|| Automation of Measuring Actual Productivity of Earthwork in Urban Area, a Case Study from Montreal|| Cash Flow Management of Construction Projects in Saudi Arabia|| Risk assessment and allocation in the contract for public works used in Saudi Arabia construction industry|| Critical Factors behind Construction Delay in Petrochemical Projects in Saudi Arabia|| Web-GIS to support maintenance reporting system: application in Saudi Arabia",|| ultra wide band (UWB); real-time location systems (RTLSs); construction sites; sensors; location positioning|| Construction labor; Physical demands; Health and safety; Machine learning; Physiological monitoring|| artificial neural network; consumption; energy prediction; factors; school buildings|| municipal solid waste (MSW); 3R-WTE; solid waste management; sustainability evaluation; waste-to-energy (WTE); Saudi Arabia|| Information technology; Quality improvement|| actual; excavation; productivity; estimation|| cash flow; Saudi Arabia; management; practices; construction; deficit|| risk assessment; public contract; Saudi Arabia; construction contracts; risk sharing|| petrochemical projects; critical factors; schedule delay|| maintenance & inspection; planning & scheduling; quality control

The objective is to explore theories on attitudinal research and propose a research model that examines the relationship between attitude, knowledge, and impact on intention to pursue a nursing career. BACKGROUND There is a paucity of research on understanding the reasons for the shortage of local nurses in the United Arab Emirates. METHOD Data were collected from 157 female high school students. The research model was empirically tested using standard procedures. RESULTS Findings support some of the proposed direct and interactional effects. Attitude is a predictor of intention of high school students to pursue a nursing profession. The interaction effect of attitude and knowledge significantly predicts intention. CONCLUSION The study calls for further investigation on the effects of attitude and knowledge on students' intention to pursue a nursing career and bring about changes in thinking.|| Social media gives firms a better platform to promote and build brand trust and loyalty. The objective of this study is to develop and validate a conceptual model that integrates the relationships among social media marketing elements, brand trust, and brand loyalty. Data was collected from 242 social media users in Saudi Arabia and the model was tested by employing structural equation modelling using SPSS and AMOS. The model was tested using a two-stage process, model evaluation and testing the significance of the model. Results of the hypotheses tests reveal that brand communities, entertainment, interaction, and customization features have a significant and positive relationship with brand trust and brand loyalty. The findings of this study provide a guide to social media marketers to build brand trust and loyalty.|| Firms engage customers to tap into product-related innovative ideas for future product development. This engagement of customers in co-creation activity provides unprecedented opportunities to create value offerings to customers. However, there is a dearth of understanding on what motivates customers to participate in co-creation activity. Based on the self-determination theory, this study proposes a model and investigates consumers' intrinsic and extrinsic motivators to participate in co-creation. The model was tested on a survey data from 235 respondents from Saudi Arabia. Results reveal that the intrinsic motivator, enjoyment, predicted attitudes towards co-creation as well as willingness to participate in co-creation. The extrinsic motivators, showcasing of personal ideas and monetary reward also predicted attitudes towards co-creation and willingness to participate. An interesting finding is that gaining knowledge is not directly associated with willingness to participate, unless it is also associated at the same time with attitude towards co-creation.|| Although there is a near agreement in the literature on the main predictors of consumers' attitudes toward technological innovation, the potential ways through which personal traits and national environmental differences contribute to significant variations in mobile-banking adoption have received limited attention. Based on insights from innovation adoption and personality research, this study tested a model of mobile-banking adoption using data from a developed and a developing country. Survey data came from a sample of 1,340 participants from the United Kingdom and Ghana. The results indicate that intrinsic traits are stronger in explaining consumers' attitude toward mobile banking in Ghana than in the United Kingdom. However, no significant variance between the two countries was observed with regard to the mediation effect of consumers' attitude on the intention to use mobile banking. The practical and theoretical implications of this study are discussed.|| Beginning with the establishment of a Supreme Commission for Tourism and Antiquities' (SCTA) in 2000, there have been official attempts by the government of Saudi Arabia to encourage domestic tourism in order to tap into the huge amounts that Saudis spend annually on vacations. This paper examines the motivations and attitudes of consumers toward tourism destinations and activities within the country (domestic tourism). Using data collected through a structured self-administered questionnaire, the study finds that familiarity and trust of the local environment, perceptions of the safer domestic environment, and limitations imposed by respondents' vacation timing are the primary motives for choosing to spend their vacations locally, while lack of quality domestic tourist sites and services (including entertainment facilities), lack of tourism information, insufficient tourism organization services, and the harsh local environmental conditions during summer are factors that `push' people from spending the vacations locally. Attitudes toward domestic tourism are generally negative, although there are significant differences in attitudes between respondents who prefer domestic destinations and those who prefer to travel out of Kingdom. Implications of the findings are outlined and discussed.|| We argue that there is a neo-colonial knowledge regime operating in business ethics. This knowledge regime engages in systematic epistemic violence of exclusion and distortion against indigenous alternative knowledge formations from the Global South. Thus, the question posed for the business ethics field from a critical perspective is how to ethically respond and challenge this situation of power and domination. We propose the idea of epistemic healing as an ethical critical response for reversing epistemic violence in business ethics. Epistemic healing requires identifying and then calling back to the center of discussion in business ethics knowledge traditions of the other that it has excluded and made peripheral. We illustrate this principle of epistemic healing in the context of Islamic business ethics given that it contains epistemic violence against Islam, particularly Sufism, an important knowledge tradition of the Muslim other from the Global South. Breaking silence on the neocolonial knowledge regime operating in the construction of business ethics, introducing the concept of epistemic healing, and illustrating the latter's fecundity in advancing debate in business ethics while also helping reverse the field's epistemic violence against alternative knowledge commitments and resources of the other from the Global South are the important contributions of this paper.|| This study investigates the importance of mindfulness-based organization systems and policies on the organization's continuous efforts to become a greener company. The study is devised as a pooled cross-sectional time series analysis of productivity in energy consumption, water utilization, and waste generation and recycling of U.S. companies. The data set taken from U.S. Newsweek 500 recorded 600 companies dispersed into 63 industries during the period of 2012-2014 and provided 1,498 company-industry-year observations. The study found that systems and policies (e.g., deployment of third-party auditors for its environmental metrics report; linkage of the remuneration of company's senior executive team with the achievement of environmental performance targets; and establishment of a committee at the Board of Directors' level whose mandate includes sustainability of the company in environment- and resource-related matters) connect the company's mindfulness to its effort in improving the environmental quality through the company's productivity in energy consumption, water utilization, and waste generation and recycling. The relationships are positive and significant. Also, systems and policies serve as a motivator for the firm to continue to improve upon the current achievements. The study emphasizes the importance of translating organizational and individual mindfulness into organization policies and systems in order to motivate the organization to continuously improve its productivity in energy consumption, water utilization, and waste generation and recycling leading to improvements in environmental quality.|| Firms and their customers enter into a relationship for mutual satisfaction. However, there is much more to learn about long-term oriented marketing relationship dynamics in Asia that lead to customer satisfaction. The goal of this study is to examine the direct and indirect effects of relational dynamics on customer satisfaction in the Asian context. Specifically, the study proposes that long-term oriented relationship variables such as fairness, empathy, and trust have significant direct impact on customer satisfaction, and indirectly through overall relationship quality. Three studies were conducted in three service sectors viz. banking, healthcare, and hospitality with data collected from two regions of Malaysia, the Peninsular region and the Borneo region. A total of 1945 usable responses were received across the three sectors and analyzed: banking (653), healthcare (666), and hospitality (626). The model was compared among the three sectors. The results show that long-term oriented marketing relationship variables predict a significant amount of variance in customer satisfaction across the three service sectors. However, the predictive powers differ from industry to industry, wherein 72% unique variance was predicted in the banking sector, 66% in healthcare, and 68% in hospitality. Relationship quality fully mediates some of the relationships in some sectors and partially mediates in others. Since Malaysia is dubbed a potpourri of Asian cultures, there is a potential for generalizability of the research findings across other Asian contexts. Theoretical, contextual, and managerial implications of the findings are discussed.|| This study investigates the role of internal marketing (IM) on employees' perceived job satisfaction and the consequent impact on customer satisfaction. A model is developed to explain the influence the factors of IM on employees' job satisfaction. Data was collected from 401 frontline employees of several types of restaurants in Saudi Arabia. The results suggest that IM practices such as leadership commitment; internal communication and reward system has a significant effect on frontline employees' perception of job satisfaction. Service training and development does not contribute to frontline employees' perception of job satisfaction. Employees' job satisfaction is a contributor to customer satisfaction. The findings broaden and deepen an understanding of how the factors of IM practices reinforce employees' job satisfaction. The results have useful implications to the restaurant business, particularly in the Middle East nations to capture IM factors, which will provide job satisfaction to employees and ultimately increases customer satisfaction.","|| Who Wants To Be a Nurse?

24,Center for Communication & IT,Research Institue,8,39,0,5,2,0,71.43,28.57,87.5,0,12.5,7,0,1,"|| Visible light communication (VLC) is a short-range wireless access technology based on the dual use of illumination structure. The frequency-selective characteristics of VLC channels motivate the use of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). In addition, the presence of multiple light sources in most indoor spaces makes multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) communication techniques a natural solution for VLC systems. In this paper, we investigate the design of an adaptive MIMO OFDM system. Specifically, we propose adaptive bit and power loading for a direct current-biased OFDM VLC system with MIMO mode switching between repetition coding and spatial multiplexing. We formulate the adaptive algorithm design as an optimization problem where we aim to maximize spectral efficiency through the proper selection of modulation order, power level, and MIMO mode, while satisfying a targeted bit error rate. To solve the underlying NP-hard problems, we use a simulated annealing heuristic. We present Monte Carlo simulation results for a typical indoor setting and illustrate the performance improvements through link adaptation.|| The traditional method to solve nondeterministic-polynomial-time (NP)-hard optimization problems is to apply meta-heuristic algorithms. In contrast, Deep Q Learning (DQL) uses memory of experience and deep neural network (DNN) to choose steps and progress towards solving the problem. The dynamic time-division multiple access (DTDMA) scheme is a viable transmission method in visible light communication (VLC) systems. In DTDMA systems, the time-slots of the users are adjusted to maximize the spectral efficiency (SE) of the system. The users in a VLC network have different channel gains because of their physical locations, and the use of variable time-slots can improve the system performance. In this work, we propose a Markov decision process (MDP) model of the DTDMA-based VLC system. The MDP model integrates into deep Q learning (DQL) and provides information to it according to the behavior of the VLC system and the objective to maximize the SE. When we use the proposed MDP model in deep Q learning with experienced replay algorithm, we provide the light emitting diode (LED)-based transmitter an autonomy to solve the problem so it can adjust the time-slots of users using the data collected by device in the past. The proposed model includes definitions of the state, actions, and rewards based on the specific characteristics of the problem. Simulations show that the performance of the proposed DQL method can produce results that are competitive to the well-known metaheuristic algorithms, such as Simulated Annealing and Tabu search algorithms.|| Filters are the fastest among the different types of feature selection methods. They employ metrics from information theory, such as mutual information (MI), Joint-MI (JMI), and minimal redundancy and maximal relevance (mRMR). The determination of the optimal feature selection set is an NP-hard problem. This work proposes the engineering of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) in which the fitness of solutions consists of two terms. The first is a feature selection metric such as MI, JMI, and mRMR, and the second term is the overlapping-coefficient that accounts for the diversity in the GA population. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can return multiple good quality solutions that also have minimal overlap with each other. Numerous solutions provide significant benefits when the test data contains none or missing values. Experiments were conducted using two publicly available time-series datasets. The feature sets are also applied to perform forecasting using a simple Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, and the solution quality of the forecasting using different feature sets is analyzed. The proposed algorithm was compared with a popular optimization tool 'Basic Open-source Nonlinear Mixed INteger programming' (BONMIN), and a recent feature selection algorithm 'Conditional Mutual Information Considering Feature Interaction' (CMFSI). The experiments show that the multiple solutions found by the proposed method have good quality and minimal overlap.|| This article proposes a heuristic for the fixed spectrum frequency assignment (FS-FA) problem of telecommunications networks. A network composes of many connections, and each connection needs a frequency from the spectrum. The assignment of frequencies to the transmitters should satisfy a set of constraints. The constraints specify the separation which is necessary between frequencies of different transmitters. Violation of constraints creates interference. The goal of the FS-FA problem is to find an assignment of frequencies for the transmitters, which has minimum interference. The proposed heuristic has two main components: a local search heuristic and a compound move. The local search heuristic employs one-change moves (i.e., a move that changes the frequency of one transmitter at a time). It also employs a lookup table that classifies all possible one-change moves as positive or negative. The local search heuristic chooses positive/negative moves until it traps in a locally minimal solution. The compound-move operation shifts the local search to a new location in the search space. We can repeatedly apply the local search and compound move for many iterations. The proposed heuristic has been evaluated on the same benchmarks as used by others in the recently published literature. We have compared our algorithm with two existing tabu-search-based algorithms: dynamic-list-based tabu search (DTS) (Montemanni et al. in IEEE Trans Veh Technol 52(4):891-901, 2003. 10.1109/TVT.2003.810976) and heuristic manipulation technique-based TS (Montemanni and Smith in Comput Oper Res 37(3):543-551, 2010. 10.1016/j.cor.2008.08.006) (HMT). The solution quality of the proposed algorithm is found to be better than or equal to the HMT and DTS in 88% and 79% of test problems, respectively.|| Due to recent advances in digital technologies, and availability of credible data, an area of artificial intelligence, deep learning, has emerged and has demonstrated its ability and effectiveness in solving complex learning problems not possible before. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in the image detection and recognition applications. However, they require intensive CPU operations and memory bandwidth that make general CPUs fail to achieve the desired performance levels. Consequently, hardware accelerators that use application-specific integrated circuits, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and graphic processing units have been employed to improve the throughput of CNNs. More precisely, FPGAs have been recently adopted for accelerating the implementation of deep learning networks due to their ability to maximize parallelism and their energy efficiency. In this paper, we review the recent existing techniques for accelerating deep learning networks on FPGAs. We highlight the key features employed by the various techniques for improving the acceleration performance. In addition, we provide recommendations for enhancing the utilization of FPGAs for CNNs acceleration. The techniques investigated in this paper represent the recent trends in the FPGA-based accelerators of deep learning networks. Thus, this paper is expected to direct the future advances on efficient hardware accelerators and to be useful for deep learning researchers.|| Cloud computing has evolved as the next-generation platform for hosting applications ranging from engineering to sciences, and from social networking to media content delivery. The numerous data centers, employed to provide cloud services, consume large amounts of electrical power, both for their functioning and their cooling. Improving power efficiency, that is, decreasing the total power consumed, has become an increasingly important task for many data centers for reasons such as cost, infrastructural limits, and mitigating negative environmental impact. Power management is a challenging optimization problem due to the scale of modern data centers. Most published work focuses on power management in computing nodes and the cooling facility in an isolated manner. In this paper, we use a combination of server consolidation and thermal management to optimize the total power consumed by the computing nodes and the cooling facility. We describe the engineering of an evolutionary non-deterministic iterative heuristic known as simulated evolution to find the best location for each virtual machine (VM) in a data center based on computational power and data center heat recirculation model to optimize total power consumption. A ""goodness"" function which is related to the target objectives of the problem is defined. It guides the moves and helps traverse the search space using artificial intelligence. In the process of evolution, VMs with high goodness value have a smaller probability of getting perturbed, while those with lower goodness value may be reallocated via a compound move. Results are compared with those published in previous studies, and it is found that the proposed approach is efficient both in terms of solution quality and computational time.|| Online Social Networking sites (OSNs) provide Internet users with a useful medium for communication, interaction and collaboration. Reported usage of OSN has pervaded all segments of society irrespective of gender, age, nationality, or educational level. This study provides analysis of how demographic factors affect OSN adoption in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The data represent a nationwide face-to-face survey of over 3000 respondents. Data stratification based on the population distribution across the Kingdom was used to select a portion of the samples from the provinces of the Kingdom. Statistical methods, including descriptive statistical analysis, logistic regression, the measure of association, and chi-square tests, were applied to analyze the data (Haight et al., 2014). OSN variables considered include the extent of usage by younger adults, usage by females, the role of education in the use of OSNs, and the dependence on the use of OSNs on the availability of technology such as mobile Internet. Findings show that education level plays a considerable role for OSN usage, teenagers and young adults use OSN more than others, Saudi nationals use OSN more than expatriates in the Kingdom, and OSN usage depends heavily on the availability of the mobile Internet.|| Frequency assignment for minimum interference is a fundamental problem in telecommunications networks. Combinatorial optimization heuristics are among the successful techniques employed to solve this problem. The heuristic proposed in this paper is a hybrid of the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II and tabu search (TS) heuristics. Although several hybrid heuristics exist, in addition to the parameters of the metaheuristics, they also contain problem-specific parameters. The proposed heuristic does not have any problem-specific parameter. In each iteration, we apply TS to each element of the population to replace it with the best solution in its neighborhood. We select the elements for the population of the next generation using the principles of the non-dominated sorting. The non-dominated sorting considers two attributes of a solution: 1) interference (i.e., a measure of the violation of constraints) and 2) entropy (i.e., a measure of the diversity of the solutions in a population).

The gain of the proposed heuristic over a recently proposed hybrid heuristic is verified using the Wilcoxon statistical test.

The investigated renewable energy sources are solar energy and geothermal energy. The low-grade energy sources such as the waste heat of photovoltaic thermal (PV/T) panels, refrigeration and heat pump systems, and power plants are also investigated. For each hybrid HDH with another driving system, the details of HDH construction, performance, hybridization method, and general observations are summarized and compared in tabular forms. Most of the studies focused on using solar energy and refrigeration and heat pump systems to drive HDH systems. The best performance indices (i.e., gained output ratio (GOR), freshwater production, and freshwater cost) can be obtained by the integration of HDH systems with power plants and then by geothermal energy, especially when a large quantity of freshwater is needed (>200 kg/h). Refrigeration systems and solar collectors can lead to higher GOR, medium water production, and higher cost. The application of PV/T results in the lowest water production. Despite the high performance of HDH driven by power plants and vapor-compression refrigeration systems, geothermal energy, solar collectors, and PV/T panels could be the right choices for hybridization with HDH systems in off-grid regions.|| Purpose The purpose of this paper is to formulate a specialized artificial neural network algorithm utilizing radial basis function (RBF) for modeling of time to failure of aircraft engine turbines. Design/methodology/approach The model uses training failure data collected from operators of turboprop aircraft working in harsh desert conditions where sand erosion is a detrimental factor in reducing turbine life. Accordingly, the model is more suited to accurate prediction of life of critical components of such engines. The used RBF employs a closest neighbor type of classifier and the hidden unit's activation is based on the displacement between the early prototype and the input vector. Findings The results of the algorithm are compared to earlier work utilizing Weibull regression modeling, as well as Feed Forward Back Propagation NN. The results show that the failure rates estimated by RBF more closely match actual failure data than the estimations by both other models. The trained model showed reasonable accuracy in predicting future failure events. Moreover, the technique is shown to have comparatively higher efficiency even with reduced number of neurons in each layer of ANN. This significantly decreases computation time with minimum effect on the accuracy of results. Originality/value Using RBF technique significantly decreases the computational time with minimum effect on the accuracy of results.|| Several classical and higher order plate theories were used to study the buckling of functionally graded material (FGM) plates. In the great majority of research, a power function is used to represent metal and ceramic material transverse distribution (P-FGM). Therefore, the effect of having other transverse variation of material properties on the buckling behavior of thick rectangular FGM plates was not properly addressed. In the present work, this effect is investigated using the Third order Shear Deformable Theory (TSDT) for the case of simply supported FGM plate. Both a sigmoid function and an exponential functions are used to represent the transverse gradual property variation. The plate governing equations are combined with a Navier type expanded solution of the unknown displacements to derive the buckling equation in terms of the pre-buckling in-plane loads. Finally, the critical in-plane load is calculated for the different buckling modes. The model is verified by a comparison of the calculated buckling loads with available published results of Al-SiC P-FGM plates. The conducted parametric study shows that manufacturing FGM plates with sigmoid variation of properties in the thickness direction increases the buckling load considerably. This improvement is found to be more significant for the case of thick plates than that of thin plates. Results also show that this stiffening-like effect of the sigmoid function profile is more evident for cases where the in-plane loads are applied along the shorter edge of the plate.|| This paper introduces and evaluates an innovative humidification-dehumidification (HDH) desalination system integrated with a double-effect absorption refrigeration system to produce an abundant amount of freshwater and to provide a cooling effect for air conditioning purposes. The seawater stream of HDH system is used to cool condenser and absorber of the absorption refrigeration system while attaining a sufficient heat to drive the HDH system. The influence of operating conditions on the integrated system performance is investigated. The performance indices are selected to be: gained output ratio (GOR), coefficient of performance (COP), energy performance, freshwater production, and freshwater cost. The system can produce freshwater of 1145 L/h and a cooling capacity of 62.45 TR. The optimal performance indices are found to be 4.54 for GOR, 1.29 for COP, and 5.83 for energy performance. Furthermore, without accounting for the cooling effect, the freshwater cost is estimated to be 2.89 $/m(3). In addition to the air conditioning capability, the integrated system performance shows an enhancement of 2.20 times for GOR, 2.21 times for freshwater production, and 8.24 times for water cost reduction over the traditional HDH system.|| This study proposes efficient exterior concrete walls (consisting of blocks, mortars, and plasters) to reduce the heat transfer to or from buildings for minimizing energy consumption due to air conditioning or heating processes. Different blocks were treated by partially or totally replacing coarse and fine aggregates with insulation materials. Mortars and plasters were also treated by partially replacing sand with certain insulation materials. A control block (without treatment) was also produced with three-row rectangular cavities to reduce the effective thermal conductivity. Experimental tests were performed to determine the thermal conductivity of blocks, mortars, and plasters, and to validate a developed three-dimensional model (using ANSYS-Fluent program). The model results showed a substantial increase in model accuracy (about 15%) by involving the estimation of radiation heat transfer in the block cavities. The thermal and economic performance of treated masonry walls showed that the optimal performance was obtained from a wall having volcanic scoria-treated blocks (200-mm thick) and 15% vermiculite-treated mortar (10-mm thick). The thermal performance was enhanced by 15% and 318% (for thermal resistance increase) and 13% and 76% (for heat flux reduction) more than those of the control and market walls, respectively. Adding 15% vermiculite-treated plaster (2 x 15-mm thick) to the wall enhanced the thermal performance remarkably. The total cost of the improved wall (having the highest thermal resistance) was reduced by 1.39 and 3.67 times over the control and market walls (Dhahran, Saudi Arabia), respectively. This improved wall is a promising candidate for exterior walls in residential and industrial buildings.|| The objective of this research is to present a model to predict failure of two categories of critical aircraft engine components; non-rotating components such as valves and gearboxes, and rotating components such as engine turbines. The work utilizes Weibull regression and artificial neural networks employing Back Propagation (BP) as well as Radial Basis Functions (RBF). The model utilizes training failure data collected from operators of turboprop aircraft working in harsh desert conditions, where sand erosion is a detrimental factor in reducing turbine life. Accordingly, the model is more suited for accurate prediction of life of critical components of such engines. The algorithm, which uses Radial Basis Function (RBF) INN, uses a closest point specifier. The activation is based on the deviation of the earlier prototype from the input vector. Two earlier models are used for comparison purposes; namely Weibull regression modeling and Feed-Forward BP network. Comparison results show that the failure times represented by RBF are in better compromise with actual failure data than both earlier modeling methods. Moreover, the technique has comparatively higher efficiency as the neurons number in each layer of ANN is reduced, to decrease computation time, with minimum effect on the accuracy of results.|| Desalination of the brackish water in a solar still enhances by increasing the evaporation and condensation rate. In this paper, a comparison is made for the productivity of a single slope solar still that is equipped with a water heater and an external fan in summer and winter, by both experimental and numerical techniques. Heater is used to enhance the evaporation and the fan is used to promote the condensation. When using a 500 W heater, it was shown that an increase of up to 370% in the fresh water yield was observed. The effect of external fan that induces 7 m/s and 9 m/s wind speeds was also studied. In addition, a thermal modeling was done to simulate the desalination process using the principles of heat and mass transfer. Numerical results were validated by the experimental measurements. It is concluded that using water heater significantly enhances the productivity during both the summer and winter. However, employing an external fan increases the productivity in the summer, but decreases it slightly in the winter.",|| Humidification-dehumidification desalination systems driven by thermal-based renewable and low-grade energy sources: A critical review|| Aircraft turbines time-to-failures process modeling using RBF NN|| Effect of material transverse distribution profile on buckling of thick functionally graded material plates according to TSDT|| Novel and efficient integration of a humidification-dehumidification desalination system with an absorption refrigeration system|| Experimental and numerical investigation on innovative masonry walls for industrial and residential buildings|| ANN-BASED FAILURE MODELING OF CLASSES OF AIRCRAFT ENGINE COMPONENTS USING RADIAL BASIS FUNCTIONS|| Performance comparison of a single slope solar still equipped with water heater and an external fan during summer and winter,|| Humidification-dehumidification; Renewable energy; Low-grade energy; Desalination; Freshwater; Performance|| Neural network; Maintenance strategies; Weibull analysis; Failure rate function; Quality maintenance|| functionally graded materials; buckling; thick plates; simply supported; sigmoid function; P-FGM; S-FGM; E-FGM|| Absorption; Desalination; Double-effect; Freshwater; Humidification-dehumidification; Refrigeration|| Insulation-treated blocks; Insulation-treated mortars; Masonry walls; Thermal resistance; Heat transfer; Cost analysis|| neural network; radial basis function; Reliability; engine components|| Solar still; Water heater; Cooling fan; Performance analysis

Though many countries have established and implemented safety programs, the situation does not seem to have been mitigated. This study aims at developing a risk assessment approach that can be used to enhance the safety performance of construction projects. The study has employed pair-wise comparisons and weighting-by-ranking surveys to establish risk scores and weights for the various construction accidents, and their potential causes. Data has been collected from safety professionals in 15 large construction sites across the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. The study revealed that the type of accident with the highest risk score is ""falling objects"", while the most significant cause is excessive winds on the project site. The developed approach was applied on an on-going car park construction project. Results showed that slips, trips and falls had the best safety performance. Furthermore, based on six sigma evaluation, the average project safety performance was at 2.33-sigma which implies that 228,739 accidents may occur in every million opportunities. The paper also provided recommendations to improve the safety performance of the case study.|| This study assesses the impact of financial education on financial capability (literacy) of young adults in Punjab, Pakistan.

However, one of the challenging decisions facing management in adopting cloud services is taking on the right combinations of cloud service delivery and deployment models. A comprehensive review of literature revealed a lack of research addressing this selection decision problem. To fill this research gap, this article proposes an expert system approach for managers to decide on the right combination of service delivery and deployment model selection. The article first proposes a rule-based expert system prototype, which provides advice based on a set of factors that represent the organizational conditions and requirements pertaining to cloud computing adoption. Next, the authors evaluate the system prototype. Lastly, the article concludes with a discussion of the results, its practical implications, limitations, and further research directions.|| Remote user authentication schemes using smart cards provide solutions for securing user authentication. The schemes rely on passwords or biometric or both, which fall apart if the password is not kept secret. Additionally, the passwords can be stolen, lost, or forgotten and the stored biometric template is highly susceptible to a number of security and privacy attacks. This study presents a new biometric-based remote user authentication scheme using smart cards. In this study, the cryptographic key is concealed with a biometric template and discarded in the registration phase. During the login phase, the key is generated using a query biometric template in such a way that the key cannot be retrieved without a successful biometric verification. The strength of the proposed scheme is that it provides resistance to tampering and theft by way of a stored biometric template, privileged insider, and a smart card attacks and achieves some good properties such as it works without password (human memorised) and provides renewable property for the protected biometric template. Additionally, this scheme combines the good features of previous works to further capitalise on their sound security and design features. Security and performance analysis of the proposed scheme shows the advantage over other existing schemes.|| Cryptography and biometrics are widely used in providing information security. Cryptographic systems rely on keys for secure information. Unlike biometric systems, the keys in cryptographic systems must be exactly reproducible and not strongly linked to the user identity. Each of the two systems has some issue associated with it. Combining cryptography and biometrics in a secure way can mitigate these issues. This paper presents a secure cryptographic authentication method based on the discrete logarithm problem. Through the security analysis of the proposed scheme, we prove that the security characteristics of the proposed scheme relative to the properties of the discrete logarithm problem. Based on the proposed scheme, a biometric cryptosystem is constructed. The proposed system evaluated using CASIA iris database from 70 different eyes, with 7 samples of each eye. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system is more effective, promising in terms of cope up to 21.41% percent of error bits within an iris code, and can generate up to 98 bits of the cryptographic key from the iris codes.","|| Construction of a double-layered polyelectrolyte-coated mesoporous silica containing residues of biogenic aspartic acid and its utilization for cadmium (II) removal|| A risk assessment approach for enhancing construction safety performance|| ASCENDANCY OF FINANCIAL EDUCATION TO ESCALATE FINANCIAL CAPABILITY OF YOUNG ADULTS: CASE OF PUNJAB, PAKISTAN|| Selection of Cloud Delivery and Deployment Models: An Expert System Approach|| Key binding biometrics-based remote user authentication scheme using smart cards|| Secure Method for Combining Cryptography with Iris Biometrics",|| Wastewater treatment; Cadmium(II); Adsorption; SBA-15; aspartic acid; Layer-by-Layer; Mesoporous adsorption|| Construction; Safety performance; Risk assessment; Six sigma|| Financial knowledge; Financial attitude; Financial behavior; Financial skills; Non-business students|| Characteristics of Cloud Computing Models; Cloud Computing Adoption; Cloud Computing Management; Cloud Deployment Models; Cloud Service Models; Decision Support; Expert systems|| nan|| Cryptography; Biometrics; Discrete logarithm problem; Biometric template protection; Authentication; Template security; Error correcting codes
27,City & Regional Planning Department,Environmental Design,5,15,1,2,1,25,50,25,80,20,0,4,1,0,"|| Road traffic crashes (RTCs) are one of the most critical public health problems worldwide. The WHO Global Status Report on Road Safety suggests that the annual fatality rate (per 100,000 people) due to RTCs in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has increased from 17.4 to 27.4 over the last decade, which is an alarming situation. This paper presents an overview of RTCs in the Eastern Province, KSA, from 2009 to 2016. Key descriptive statistics for spatial and temporal distribution of crashes are presented. Statistics from the present study suggest that the year 2012 witnessed the highest number of crashes, and that the region Al-Ahsa had a significantly higher proportion of total crashes. It was concluded that the fatality rate for the province was 25.6, and the mean accident to injury ratio was 8:4. These numbers are substantially higher compared to developed countries and the neighboring Gulf states. Spatial distribution of crashes indicated that a large proportion of severe crashes occurred outside the city centers along urban highways. Logistic regression models were developed to predict crash severity. Model estimation analysis revealed that crash severity can be attributed to several significant factors including driver attributes (such as sleep, distraction, overspeeding), crash characteristics (such as sudden deviation from the lane, or collisions with other moving vehicles, road fences, pedestrians, or motorcyclists), and rainy weather conditions. After critical analysis of existing safety and infrastructure situations, various suitable crash prevention and mitigation strategies, for example, traffic enforcement, traffic calming measures, safety education programs, and coordination of key stakeholders, have been proposed.|| With the operational advancement of e-commerce, the need for retail stores and facilities in commercial cores is somewhat challenged. The shift toward virtual shopping limits the need for physical and purpose-oriented trips to prime shopping locations. Such spaces are being replaced by warehousing, retail outlets, or other types of storage facilities away from downtown locations. While a growing consensus exists to support this spatial transformation, not much has been done in terms of an academic inquiry and a critical analysis of the nature and impact of the shift from physicality to virtuality. This paper theoretically investigates the impacts of transition on spatial organization by analyzing contemporary city structures and key determinants while studying the expanding operational breadth of e-commerce and its resulting impacts. The paper also develops a framework for understanding the current and potential consequences of e-commerce on contemporary intellectual constructs of land use and sheds light on the transition. The framework will cause urban planners and policy makers to (re-)think current planning approach(es) and investment opportunities in the future or transitional cities.|| Rapid urban expansion and population growth in Saudi cities over the past four decades have increased vehicular accidents and traffic congestion and have impacted the daily walking conditions of the residents. Walking has various health and environmental benefits. In North American and European countries, three factors have been found to motivate a resident to walk within their community: their accessibility to community social and business facilities, their perception and willingness, and the safety conditions of the roads and sidewalks within their community for walking. This study examined these factors and their role in the walking habits of the residents in the neighborhoods of Doha and Dana districts in Saudi Arabia's eastern city of Dhahran. Data were collected through field observations and by randomly sampling and interviewing 200 residents. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and SPSS statistical software were used for data analysis. The results show that most of the community facilities are randomly placed in the districts. Mosques are the closest facility to each resident with an average accessibility distance of 242m. Almost 43% of the respondents prefer daily walking while the rest are hesitant due to hot weather during summer and narrow and poorly designed sidewalks. The sidewalks were also found to be blocked by trees, street signals, and illegally parked vehicles. Future studies should explore the accessibility to facilities, willingness, climate, and health conditions of the residents, and the road and sidewalk conditions for walking in other cities of the Kingdom.|| Saudi Arabia is one of the most energy intensive countries in the world in terms of per capita consumption. Highly subsidized energy prices and low tariffs are driving up domestic energy consumption. The rapidly growing energy demand has prompted the country to undertake several energy-saving measures. These initiatives, however, are all technology driven and no apparent measures have yet been taken to modify end users' behavior. In order to reduce the rate of growth of residential energy consumption, besides appropriate regulations, it is critical to engage end users through better education and awareness. Thus, this study aims to investigate the impact of behavior-based, non-technical interventions on end users' perceptions of energy conservation and, subsequently, any actual reduction in household energy consumption. Taking Khobar city as the geographical focus, 88 participating households were randomly chosen for interventions. The households were divided into two treatment and one control group. Analysis of the six-month intervention revealed a positive but statistically insignificant impact on energy conservation. The results suggest that there is a positive relation between the number of adults in the family and level of education with the energy consumption while number of female members in family, family size, building area shows a negative association attributing to 'economies of scale' and existence of pro-environmental behavior. In the end, this study attempts to build a foundational ground for policy prescription on energy conservation based on 'investment' and 'curtailment' behavior approaches to assess the 'longevity' effects.

One major consequence of such growth is the rising of the city's land surface temperature (LST). This study used Landsat 7 ETM+ sensor data to map the distribution of Riyadh's LST and then examined and modelled the impacts of five contributing factors known to increase urban LST. The contributing factors are size/area and population density of each neighbourhood, along with amounts of impervious surfaces, vegetations, and soil/sand measured through remote sensing indices NDBI, NDVI, and NDBsI. The data were analyzed using Pearson's Product Moment Correlation values, Path Analysis, and Multiple Regression analysis. The result shows that neighbourhood population densities and NDBsI index have strong positive correlations (r=0.68 and r=0.60) with LST. Neighbourhood area showed significant but low positive correlation (r=0.33) and the NDBI and NDVI indices showed strong negative correlations (r=-0.55 and r=-0.64) with the LST. The multiple regression model explained about 77% of the total variation in the LST. The model can be used to predict and simulate future LST distribution for Riyadh as well as other cities in the Kingdom and the region.","|| The Dilemma of Road Safety in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia: Consequences and Prevention Strategies|| Framework Analysis of E-Commerce Induced Shift in the Spatial Structure of a City|| Examining the Walking Accessibility, Willingness, and Travel Conditions of Residents in Saudi Cities|| Households energy conservation in Saudi Arabia: Lessons learnt from change-agents driven interventions program|| Examining and Modelling the Determinants of the Rising Land Surface Temperatures in Arabian Desert Cities: An Example from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",|| road safety; traffic crashes; logistic regression; GIS; prevention and mitigation strategies; Saudi Arabia|| E-commerce; Physicality; Virtuality; Spatial shift; Spatial structure|| walkability; built environment; accessibility; willingness and perception; safety; road conditions|| Energy conservation; Behavioral change; Longevity effects; Conservation practice|| land surface temperature; population density; land cover; urban heat island; urban climate

The study concentrated on the adoption of the NEBIC model among various online sellers (small, medium and large firms, based on a number of employees and sales volume). Convenience sampling was used to collect the data from the proposed sample size of 500. A total of 338 responses were received. The structural equation modelling (SEM) method was used for path analysis via AMOS 21 and results revealed a reasonable fit between data collected and the model used: chi2 (125.292), chi2 / DF (5.221), RMSEA (0.111), CFI (0.969), and TLI (0.941). The model confirmed that there has been high co-linearity exist among all the constructs. The results also revealed that the multi-groups (i.e., sectors with different levels of online selling adoption, firms with different online buying orientations, and firms with different sizes) moderates a significant role on the research model. The multigroup analysis showed significant evidence that smaller firms with no prior online buying in sectors characterized as having lower online selling adoption rates may produce better results in their adoption of online selling. The study is limited to organizations working in Saudi Arabia. Future work will focus on different nations' online businesses to test the multi-group investigation.|| This article proposes a research model that explores the social factors affecting knowledge sharing and employee engagement and examines the mediating role of knowledge sharing on employee engagement. Data was collected from 191 employees from a large holding company and the research model was empirically tested using partial least squares analysis. The results show that coworker congruence, organizational commitment, and participative decision-making affect knowledge sharing and employee engagement. The findings also reveal that knowledge sharing has a full mediation effect between coworker congruence and employee engagement and between decision-making and employee engagement. In addition, knowledge sharing also has a partial mediation effect between organizational commitment and employee engagement. This study is a pioneering attempt to understand the effects of social factors on knowledge sharing and employee engagement. The findings of this study will be helpful to organizations using knowledge sharing systems as mechanisms to promote knowledge sharing and employee engagement.|| The purpose of this paper is to examine the utilization of listening tools by telecommunication companies to obtain information about customer preferences, needs, and perceptions of companies' performance to facilitate customer relationship management and to identify some leading activities for managing customer relationships and satisfaction. A survey addressed to employees at three management levels (top, middle, and operational) at the three leading mobile telecommunication companies in Saudi Arabia. The most effective listening tools are those that align with the organization's objectives. Customer complaints and visits were the most effective and important tools, while observation and focus groups were the least effective listening tools that Saudi telecom companies use. Further, the study profiled the factors drawn from the major objectives of using listening tools in two main areas: customer satisfaction and customer relationship. A further study might expand the scope of this research by observing only social media platforms in a complaint-handling context. Additionally, the uses and benefits of listening tools and their impact on customer satisfaction and relationships might differ across different consumer business service sectors. The findings will shed some light on the telecommunication sector in Saudi Arabia for policymakers and administrators for the purpose of planning, designing, and using listening tools in customer relationship efficiently and effectively. Telecommunication companies should invest in advanced technology and prioritize social media to get in touch with customers and be close to them. The primary contribution of this research is its discussion of a variety of customer listening tools used by Saudi telecommunication companies. Additionally, this study profiled the factors drawn from the major objectives of using listening tools in two main areas: customer satisfaction and customer relationship.|| Cloud computing is a new technology that has great potential for the business world. Many business firms have implemented, are implementing, or planning to implement cloud computing technology. The cloud computing resources are delivered in various forms of service models which make it challenging for business customers to select the model that suits their business needs. This paper proposes a novel group-based decision-making method where a group of decision makers is involved in the decision process. Each decision maker provides weights for the cloud selection criteria. Based on weight aggregations and deviations, decision makers would select the alternative which has the highest ratio of deviation to mean is selected. The method is illustrated with an example on the selection of cloud service models. This method is useful for IT managers in selecting the appropriate cloud service model for their organizations.",|| Driving Forces for Business Growth in Saudi Arabia: Industrial Cross-Sectional Analysis|| Investigating the Mediating Role of Knowledge Sharing on Employee Engagement: Evidence from a Developing Nation|| The Efficiency of Listening Tools' Usage in Customer Relationship Management: The case of telecom companies|| A Group Decision-Making Method for Selecting Cloud Computing Service Model,|| Net-enablement; Online sellers; Multi-group analysis; Firms' size|| Coworker Congruence; Employee Engagement; Knowledge Sharing; Organizational Commitment; Participative Decision-Making; Task Interdependence|| Listening tools; customer relations; customer satisfaction; customer service|| Cloud computing; cloud service models; multi-criteria decision-making; group decision-making

Based on an ethnographic case study from a village in Southern Punjab, information from semi-structured interviews and observations is used to demonstrate an enhanced access to education has altered women's everyday mobility trends. However, questions regarding women's empowerment remain unresolved. Although some rural women have always been engaged in agricultural activities, there have been limitations on their mobility due to cultural sensitivities. I conclude the nature of social and socio-spatial relationships is being negotiated in some cultural contexts of rural Punjab through the changing facets of women's mobility associated with modern education.|| Depressive symptoms commonly begin in late childhood and early adolescence and, left untreated, can increase in frequency and severity and last through adulthood. Recent estimates of depression rates among Malaysian adolescents have been as high as 24%, suggesting a need for effective intervention measures. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is a widely accepted and empirically validated psychological intervention for depression. This project took an existing CBT programme targeting adolescent depressive symptoms and adapted it for use with Malaysian high school students. The resulting eight session school-based ""STAR"" CBT module was assessed through a pilot study involving 20 Malaysian secondary students (10 intervention and 10 control) who reported clinical levels of depressive symptoms on a screening survey. Results showed lower levels of depressive symptoms, post-intervention and 1-month post-intervention, in intervention but not control groups. Similar results were also found for frequency of automatic negative thoughts. These results indicate that the Malay-language 'STAR' CBT protocol could be an effective means of reducing depressive symptoms among Malaysian high school students in school settings.|| This article aims to examine the rise of religiously-inspired violent extremism and Islamist militancy, which challenges democracy and civic pluralism in contemporary Indonesia. Additionally, this article offers possible ways of resolving conflict and building peace and dialogue with the radicals and Islamists in this archipelagic country. Following the political reformation in 1998 that marked the end of the New Order rule, violent conflict and Islamist radicalism broke out in some areas of Indonesia. There have been numerous types of violence in post-Suharto Indonesia, each with different roots, objectives, factors and histories. This article, however, focuses solely on religious violence and Islamist militancy, and it examines models, approaches and practices of conflict transformation and strategic peacebuilding that are suitable for Indonesian society.

30,Information System & Operations Management Department,KFUPM Business School,3,1,0,1,0,0,100,0,0,0,100,0,0,3,"|| The density of nanofluids is an important thermophysical property whose value is required to evaluate various heat-transfer parameters such as the Reynolds number, the Nusselt number, pressure loss, and the Darcy friction factor. The determination of these parameters is central to the design of many heat-transfer applications. Notably, the density of nanofluids has received relatively little research attention compared with other thermophysical properties. The present study thus focuses on the development of a support vector regression model to estimate the densities of aluminum nitride, titanium nitride, and silicon nitride nanoparticles dispersed in ethylene glycol solution. As inputs, the proposed model uses the mass fraction, temperature, nanoparticle size, and the molecular weight of the nanoparticles. The proposed model predicts the nanofluid densities with high accuracy, as determined by a correlation coefficient of 99.87% and an absolute average relative deviation of 0.0701. To further highlight the accuracy of the proposed model, we compare its results with those of the model of Pak and Cho. The Pak and Cho results deviate considerably from the experimental data except at 298K. Overall, the proposed support vector regression model is much more accurate than the Pak and Cho model. We thus conclude that the machine learning approach is more reliable for obtaining rapid estimates of the density of nanofluids.|| Purpose Customer privacy and security are major concerns. Online firms worldwide collect customer data for various reasons. This study aims to investigate factors that motivate and hinder a customer's willingness to disclose personal information (WTD) to online firms on e-commerce websites. Design/methodology/approach Based on an extensive literature review, three sets of factors have been identified. These sets of factors are privacy concern, perceived disclosure benefits and privacy assurances. It is hypothesized that privacy concerns negatively affect the disclosure of personal information, while the perceived benefits of disclosure have positive effects. Privacy assurances would positively affect information disclosure and attenuate the negative effect of privacy concerns on the disclosure of personal information. The authors gathered data from 253 online customers in Saudi Arabia. Findings The results indicate that perceived disclosure benefits and privacy concerns have a significant positive and negative relationship, respectively, with WTD online. Privacy assurances had neither a direct nor a moderating effect on information disclosure. Research limitations/implications The findings will inform online firms about the factors that prevent or motivate customers to disclose personal information. Originality/value The effect of privacy concerns and benefits on personal information disclosure are not fully understood in Saudi Arabia. This study reveals more insights into the specific factors that make online customers reluctant or motivated to disclose their personal information.|| This study provides a systematic analysis of research on the electricity sector in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries in the period 1983-2018. GCC countries have experienced tremendous economic growth in the past few decades. This was accompanied by a corresponding increase in electricity consumption. Therefore, a thorough review is needed to understand the research conducted on the electricity sector in GCC countries. This study reviewed articles published in five well-known energy journals: Applied Energy, Energy, Energy Economics, Energy Policy, and Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews. The articles were classified into seven categories based on the analysis tools implemented in the papers: 1. Simulation tools, 2. Scenarios tools, 3. Equilibrium tools, 4. Top-down tools, 5. Bottom-up tools, 6. Operations optimization tools, and 7. Investment optimization tools. This study also provides an overview of the research, including the increase in publications over time, an authorship analysis, a keywords analysis, and an analysis of the length of the publications.",|| A machine learning-based model to estimate the density of nanofluids of nitrides in ethylene glycol|| The willingness to disclose personal information: Trade-off between privacy concerns and benefits|| Survey and analysis of the quantitative methods used in electricity research on GCC countries: 1983-2018,|| nan|| Privacy concerns; Perceived disclosure benefits; Privacy assurance mechanisms; Personal information disclosure|| Energy; Energy economics; Renewable energy resources; Energy sustainability; Energy conservation; Urban energy consumption; Electricity; Demand and supply; Literature review; GCC; Analysis tools; Renewable energy
31,Center of Research Excellence in Islamic Banking and Finance,Research Institue,2,0,0,1,0,0,100,0,0,50,50,0,1,1,"|| Purpose The purpose of this study is to update the investment literature by providing latest evidence of performance of Islamic mutual funds by using global sample mutual funds data to support with empirical facts. Design/methodology/approach This study analyzes the comparative performance of Islamic and conventional mutual funds by using capital asset pricing model, Fama & French's three-factor model and Carhart's four-factor model. Further, the study tested the coskenwness effect by using data envelopment analysis approach. Findings The authors find evidence that when size of the funds is controlled, Islamic investment underperform the conventional mutual funds in four out of six models. The size of underperformance varies from model to model: from 32 basis points in the Carhart's four-factor model with the skewness factor to two basis points at the Fama and French's three-factor model. Also the study finds that alpha(s) are only insignificant for conventional mutual funds when the skewness factor is included in the regression. While comparing the loading on Islamic mutual funds, results show that Islamic mutual funds are less risky than conventional mutual funds when they are controlled for skewness. Originality/value This study uses the different factor models of performance evolution which help in overcoming weakness of measuring the Islamic mutual funds' performance.|| We demonstrate that religious scholars play a significant role in shaping investment preferences of Muslim investors. We hand-collect texts containing Shari'a compliance advises (SCAs) by influential Shari'a scholars about the status of firms that planned an initial public offering (IPO) in Saudi Arabia during the period from 2005 to 2017. We found that the number of individuals subscribing to an IPO, on average, drops by around 60% if all Shari'a scholars agree, in their SCAs, to reject the firm as a Shari'a-compliant firm during the subscription period. Interestingly, if the scholars disagree, individuals show no significant reaction to scholars whose SCAs rejected the IPO.",|| Performance measurement of Islamic mutual funds using DEA method|| Muslim investors and the capital market: The role of religious scholars,|| Islamic mutual fund; Asset pricing model; Coskewness; Ethical investment|| Religion; Social responsibility investments; Islamic finance; Initial public offering (IPO); Saudi Arabia
32,Geosciences Department,Petroleum Engineering & Geosciences,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,100,100,0,0,1,0,0,"|| The early Miocene Wadi Waqb carbonate in the Midyan Peninsula, NE Red Sea is of great interest not only because of its importance as an archive of one of the few pre-salt synrift carbonate platforms in the world, but also as a major hydrocarbon reservoir. Despite this importance, little is known about the diagenesis and heterogeneity of this succession. This study uses petrographical, elemental chemistry, stable isotope (delta C-13 and delta O-18) and clumped isotope (Delta(47)) analyses to decipher the controlling processes behind the formation of various diagenetic products, especially dolomite, from two locations (Wadi Waqb and Ad-Dubaybah) that have experienced different diagenetic histories. Petrographically, the dolomites in both locations are similar, and characterized by euhedral to subhedral crystals (50-200 mu m) and fabric-preserving dolomite textures. Clumped isotope analysis suggests that slightly elevated temperatures were recorded in the Ad-Dubaybah location (up to 49 degrees C), whereas the Wadi Waqb location shows a sea-surface temperature of c. 30 degrees C. These temperature differences, coupled with distinct delta O-18(VPDB) values, can be used to infer the chemistry of the fluids involved in the dolomitization processes, with fluids at the Wadi Waqb location displaying much higher delta O-18(SMOW) values (up to +4 parts per thousand) compared to those at the Ad Dubaybah location (up to -3 parts per thousand). Two different dolomitization models are proposed for the two sites: a seepage reflux, evaporative seawater mechanism at the Wadi Waqb location; and a fault-controlled, modified seawater mechanism at the Ad-Dubaybah location. At Ad-Dubaybah, seawater was modified through interaction with the immature basal sandstone aquifer, the Al-Wajh Formation. The spatial distribution of the dolostone bodies formed at these two locations also supports the models proposed here: with the Wadi Waqb location exhibiting massive dolostone bodies, while the dolostone bodies in the Ad-Dubaybah location are mostly clustered along the slope and platform margin. Porosity is highest in the slope sediments due to the interplay between higher precursor porosity, the grain size of the original limestone and dolomitization. Ultimately, this study provides insights into the prediction of carbonate diagenesis in an active tectonic basin and the resultant porosity distribution of a pre-salt carbonate reservoir system.","|| Impact of basin architecture on diagenesis and dolomitization in a fault-bounded carbonate platform: outcrop analogue of a pre-salt carbonate reservoir, Red Sea rift, NW Saudi Arabia",|| nan

While appropriating others' ideas and passing them off as one's own is considered unethical in Western academia, the concept of textual ownership varies from culture to culture. Thus, this paper investigates the pedagogical and academic currency of establishing plagiarism policies in English as a foreign language (EFL) contexts (and Saudi Arabia specifically) without accounting for the role local writing traditions and culture play in academia. Whereas much previous literature has examined plagiarism policies situated in English as a second language (ESL) contexts, this paper examines challenges that may be particular to EFL contexts and lays out a framework for establishing plagiarism policies therein.",|| Developing Plagiarism Policies in EFL Contexts: A Saudi Arabian Focus,|| academic integrity; contrastive rhetoric; intercultural rhetoric; plagiarism; second language writing; textual ownership

This paper focuses on development of mathematical models for natural ventilation and mechanical ventilation through the use of temperature differences, and on design of a control strategy for hybrid ventilation that switches between control actions for both ventilation modes to optimize energy consumption while maintaining IAQ and thermal comfort at the desired setpoints. These control actions are developed to automatically adjust the position of motorized dampers at the button of the cavity, the position of the motorized windows of the test-cell, and turn on the air-supply fan only when needed. The paper ends with a demonstration and discussion of real experiments on the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy for hybrid ventilation in the test-cell building case study.",|| Modeling and Control of Hybrid Ventilation in a Building With Double Skin Facade,|| Ventilation; Windows; Skin; Temperature sensors; Monitoring; IAQ comfort; energy efficiency; hybrid ventilation; provision of fresh air; hybrid control systems; natural ventilation; mechanical ventilation
35,Accounting & Finance Department,KFUPM Business School,1,0,0,0,0,,,,0,0,100,0,0,1,"|| Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present a case study on the use of performance-based contracting in the outsourcing of a reliability-centered maintenance program of a Gulf oil refinery. Design/methodology/approach A case study method is used whereby data are collected through semi-structured interviews, informal discussions with executives from the participant companies, in addition to official documents and secondary materials. Findings The case analysis reveals the use of a risk-reward payment scheme and key performance indicators (KPIs) deployed to support the management of the outsourced maintenance function. The financial incentive scheme was clearly designed to motivate the outsourcing contractor to achieve more financial benefits when meeting a defined set of KPIs while also delivering operating cost savings and other qualitative benefits to the outsourcing company. Managing the outsourced function also involved the use of routine budgetary control systems, in addition to other informal control mechanisms such as trust, knowledge sharing, mutual understanding and co-operation between the two collaborative partners. Originality/value The case study presents new empirical evidence on the use of performance risk-reward payment schemes in the management of an outsourcing relationship. Findings reported in the study will add to the existing literature on maintenance performance measurement and management practices in outsourcing relationships.",|| The use of performance-based contracting in managing the outsourcing of a reliability-centered maintenance program A case study,|| Performance measurement; Outsourcing; Incentive; Risk-reward payment schemes; Reliability-centered maintenance; Maintenance performance measurement and management; Performance-based contracting
